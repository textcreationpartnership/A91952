         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS Treatiſe preſents you with the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of three Wars ſuſtained in <hi>France,</hi> in defence of the Reformed Churches there; the occaſion of the firſt was <hi>Bearne;</hi> that of the ſecond, the not obſerving the Peace made at <hi>Montpellier;</hi> and that of the third, was the hope to ſave <hi>Rochelle:</hi> But our ſins fought againſt us; for inſtead of profiting, we were hardned by the chaſtiſements God ſent us. In the two firſt Wars, the diviſions appeared but as ſcattered sparks, which in the laſt united to make a general confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration, there being no place, where Corruption had not ſeated it ſelf, and Avarice excluded Piety; ſo that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of expecting any overtures from our enemies, every one proſtitut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:170346:4"/>
Repoſe: Nor will our Poſterity eaſily believe themſelves deſcended from ſuch Noble Grandfathers, and ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Fathers, if they look not higher, to wit, to God, who raiſes, and abates the Courages of men, according as his good pleaſure is to diſcover his Wonders to his Church, in raiſing it from the duſt; when the powers of the world conceive it buried there, and depreſſing it again, when Pride, and an Abuſe of his Graces, are the only Product of them.</p>
            <p>And here I ſpeak to you Princes, and Common-wealths, whom God hath honoured with his Knowledge, bleſt with his Favours, advanced to the height of Dignity, and even ſatiated with Riches; take warning by us, and boaſt not your ſelves in the Arme of fleſh, and the greatneſs of your Forces; in the height of your Proſperity beware a Fall; for then are you neareſt danger: Many of you have with dry Eyes, and lethargique Arms, been Spectators of our Tragedy, without contributing any thing to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; and we our Selves, have ſeen the Ships, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of others ingratefully promoting the ruine of thoſe, who relioved them in their neceſſity: God will not fail to do his work without you, when the time of our deliverance ſhall come; He is nearer to us in our Adverſity, than you are to him in your Proſperity; if we are obliged to implore his Favour, you are much more to prevent his Judgments. Let the examples of others be your inſtruction, and while it is yet time, conſider from what ſource your bleſſings flow, and give the honour and glory of it to him, to whom it is only due. In the mean time, prepare your ſelves to ſee here, without any diſguiſe, the naked truth of what paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in our late trouble.</p>
            <p>I have begun this Hiſtory at the death of <hi>Henry</hi> the Great; for that during the minority of the King, his Son, the Maximes laid down by the Father, for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>France,</hi> were changed, and the foundation of the perſecution of thoſe of the Reformed Religion laid,
<pb facs="tcp:170346:5"/>
which had like alſo to have proved the ſubverſion of all <hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> and given its Monarchy to the houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I leave it to Poſterity, to the end, that after my death, the truth of things which I have ſeen, may not be obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, either by the Fables of Flatterers, or the Invectives of our Perſecutors: I have done it, without any the leaſt Fiction, or Paſſion, and ſhall leave every man his liberty to judge of it, as he ſhall pleaſe.</p>

               <p>The chiefeſt means they uſed to remove him from the helme, were, to raiſe a jealouſie in the Queen of the auſterity of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, who oppoſed her in her liberalities; and to perſwade her, that, having need of the Popes favour to ſtrengthen her authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſhe could not ſuffer one of the Reformed Religion, to have any hand in the Government of the State; Prevalent reaſons with a Princeſs, who was a Forraigner little verſed in State matters, jealous of her authority, and diſtruſtful of all ſorts of people: But in the end experience diſcovered it to be the ruine of the State; For the Grandees grew up to a height that diminiſhed the Royal power; the Treaſuries were drained, the Arſenals ſtrangely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed, and the compariſon of that miſerable condition of <hi>France</hi> with that flouriſhing one, the Duke of <hi>Sully</hi> left it in, clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates, how highly prejudicial to the State, was his removal from his employments in it.</p>
               <p>The Marſhal <hi>Boüillon,</hi> a man of great courage and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, able to procure great good, and no leſſe miſchief to a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,</hi> and who had been alwayes curbed by the late King, who was jealous of him, finding himſelf now at liberty, uſes all manner of inventions, to make himſelf thought uſeful, and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170346:6"/>
The firſt was to endeavour wholly to poſſeſſe the ſpirit of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> whoſe kinſman he was, and to perſwade him to become one of the Reformation, by that means to make himſelf the Chief, and Protector of a party, that was then very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and with ſuch induſtry carryed he on his Plots, that the Queen conceived great ſuſpitions of him; and therefore to divert this blow, ſought after him, who as ſoone as he had made his conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with her, effaces the deſires he had infuſed into the Prince, to imitate the vertuous actions of his Anceſtors; ſhewing him the thornes were in the way to honour, the perils, hardſhips and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe accidents are met withal, in the purſuit of it; In ſhort, the miſery and poverty that accompany it, which proved moſt effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all reaſons to diſſwade him from a deſigne ſo contrary to his nature.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> in the mean time, who was Colonel of the <hi>Switzers,</hi> was commanded away to the ſiege of <hi>Juilliers,</hi> taking with him a Regiment of the <hi>Switzers,</hi> and having the command of the French Army in the abſence of the Marſhal <hi>de la Chaſtre,</hi> who was the Lieutenant General. At his return from this expedition, he finds how cruelly they oppreſſe his Father-in-Law the Duke of <hi>Sully;</hi> and that, after they had taken from him the <hi>Baſtille,</hi> to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe of the treaſure in it, and his command of the <hi>Finances,</hi> to rob <hi>France</hi> with fuller liberty, they were now reſolved upon his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſtruction, ſo to deprive him of all means to reſent ſuch indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities: But ſeeing that it was beyond their skill by any ordinary wayes to blemiſh the adminiſtration of any of his Offices, the Marſhal <hi>Boüillon,</hi> who had infected the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and the Count of <hi>Soiſſons</hi> with the ſame malitious intention, contrived this deſigne for his ruine, <hi>viz.</hi> to procure a General Aſſembly of thoſe of the Religion, which was granted to be held at <hi>Chaſtelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raut</hi> on the five and twentieth of <hi>May,</hi> in the year 1611, in which he promiſed himſelf power enough to cauſe the Duke of <hi>Sully</hi> to be entirely abandoned, ſo that without any fear of thoſe of the Religion, he might be arraigned before Commiſſioners impowered for his trial; and moreover, that by his induſtry he ſhould ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Aſſembly, and all the affairs of the Reformed party, that he ſhould make himſelf the only man conſiderable: To bring this Project to paſſe, he vailes it with a pretence of much affection to thoſe of the Reformation, and large promiſes of an <hi>Amelioration</hi> in their affairs; and communicates it to the Marſhal <hi>de Leſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guieres,</hi> and <hi>Du Pleſſis Mornay</hi> in particular, by <hi>Bellugeon</hi> an atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant of <hi>Leſdiguieres,</hi> who when he had been with them, returnes with theſe following Inſtructions from <hi>Du Pleſſis.</hi>

               <p>Theſe Inſtructions were ſent abroad among the Provinces, where every one according to the extent of his power, and credit got them received, and reſolved on. The aimes of theſe Gentlemen were diverſe; that of <hi>Du Pleſſis</hi> was ſincere, that of the Marſhal <hi>Leſdiguieres</hi> (as the whole courſe of his life has diſcovered) tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only to his own intereſt; as alſo that of the Marſhal <hi>Boüillon,</hi> who made uſe of the power of others to convert all to his own advantage: For having filled the Provinces with hopes of better<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their condition, and made them enter into moſt ſtrict reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for that end, diſcovers all at Court, ſhews them to <hi>Villeroy,</hi> and to the Embaſſadors of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> to whom he alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended much zeal for the Reformed Religion: And after this takes a journey to <hi>Sedan,</hi> that he might the better give the Court leiſure
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170346:8"/>
to foſter fears of the iſſue of this Aſſembly, and finde out meanes to render it ineffectual: His deſires in this met a wiſhed ſucceſs; for at his return he treated fully with <hi>Villeroy,</hi> and having made his conditions for the Government of <hi>Poictou,</hi> worth three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Livers, either for himſelf, or to be diſpoſed of as he ſhould order, and a hundred thouſand Livers augmentation upon the Taxes of the common people, which by his appointment were diſpoſed to ſeveral particular perſons: he promiſes to change all the reſolutions of the Aſſembly, and give it ſuch an iſſue, as ſhould highly content the Queen; which he confirmed by an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragable Teſtimony; for reviſiting the aforeſaid Embaſſadours, and particularly <hi>Arſens,</hi> he begins a diſcourſe concerning thoſe of the Reformation, quite contrary to his former before his Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to <hi>Sedan, viz.</hi> That during the Kings Minority they were better entertain a little patience, than thoughts of bettering their condition, and by that means juſtly purchaſe the Kings favour; that for his part he went to the Aſſembly with thoughts tending only to peace, and wholly bent to endeavour a ſubmiſſion of all to the pleaſure of the Court. This much aſtoniſhed <hi>Arſens,</hi> who conceived now that his compoſition was made, which he diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled not at all to his friends: When he had made this progreſs, his favourites and creatures ſeconded it with diſcourſes of the ſame nature, the better at a diſtance to diſpoſe the people to a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with his deſires: And becauſe <hi>Chaſtelleraut</hi> was within the Government of the Duke of <hi>Sully,</hi> whoſe ruine he thirſted after, he cauſed the Aſſembly to adjourn from thence to <hi>Saumure,</hi> the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Du Pleſſis,</hi> that he might the more oblige him to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with him.</p>
               <p>Before the Seſſion of the Aſſembly, he informs <hi>Du Pleſſis</hi> by ſeveral perſons of quality that he would not be Preſident of it; that though they elected him, yet would he not accept of the charge, and that it was his deſire, he ſhould impart this his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to all he ſhould ſee; for that he thought it very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for any of the great ones to undertake it. This extreamely pleaſed them all, eſpecially the Dukes of <hi>Rohan</hi> and <hi>Sully,</hi> who now caſt their eyes upon <hi>Du Pleſſis,</hi> and aſſured him that they would carry it for him: But the Marſhal <hi>Boüillon,</hi> coming the laſt of all, and after they had waited for him a day beyond the time prefixed, (though not without much murmurings, for that his miſchievous deſignes began now to be diſcovered) viſits <hi>Du Pleſſis,</hi> and tells him, that notwithſtanding what had been ſaid concerning the Preſidentſhip, he now deſired their nomination, for that he knew the Duke of <hi>Sully</hi> had with much boaſting threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened to prevent him of it; that it was a thing that his many ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170346:8"/>
to the Party had merited of them; and that in caſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed him the honour, he would be gone the next morning: This change of his minde wrought no alteration at all in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions of the Dukes, who found the greateſt part of the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces diſpoſed to their inclinations; ſo that whatever ſuit or parties the Marſhal <hi>Boüillon</hi> could make, he had the voices but of ſix Provinces, and <hi>Du Pleſſis</hi> of ten; who when he took his place, had <hi>Chamier</hi> a Miniſter, choſen for his aſſiſtant, and <hi>Desbordes Mercier</hi> for Secretary. This election ſo nettled <hi>De Boüillon,</hi> that returning to his Lodging he brake forth into words of diſguſt, and threats of vengeance againſt all thoſe that had hindred him of the Preſidentſhip; finding well by this Eſſay, that he was now like to faile of all he had promiſed himſelf from the Aſſembly: However, obliged both by prudence, and the importunate ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations of thoſe that were equally friends to them both, he recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled himſelf to the Duke of <hi>Sully,</hi> whom he had before declared to be his greateſt enemy.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing the Aſſembly took into their conſideration, was the diſorder committed at <hi>Chastillon,</hi> contrary to the expreſs Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Marſhal <hi>Boüillon</hi> and the <hi>Sieur Frere</hi> Commiſſioners appointed by the King for that particular affaire, for which the Marſhal pretended ſo high a diſpleaſure, that having diſpatch'd thither <hi>Beauchamp,</hi> one of his Gentlemen, to enquire into the truth of the matter, he declared as his opinion, that it was fit the Aſſembly ſhould chooſe <hi>Senas</hi> for their Deputy, to be ſent to the Court with full inſtructions, and a ſtrict charge to declare, That they would not treat of any thing with the Kings Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, before reparation were made for that wrong: But that violent heat quickly abated; for he preſently excuſed himſelf from medling any further in it, becauſe his Commiſſion was expired.</p>
               <p>After this the Kings Commiſſioners had audience, who in all their diſcourſes pretended, that the preſervation of thoſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion was involved with, and neceſſary to that of the State, aſſuring them of their Majeſties favour, that they would graciouſly receive all their Remonſtrances and Petitions, cauſe their Edicts and Conceſſions to be obſerved, put thoſe that had hitherto been neglected, in execution; and interpret to their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, what was obſcure in them. And laſtly, That they left it to the choice of the Aſſembly, either to put their Papers into their hands, or ſend them to the Court, proteſting, that which way ſoever they took, they ſhould have a quick and favourable diſpatch.</p>
               <p>From theſe fair promiſes ſprung no leſs fair hopes; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170346:9"/>
to the inſtructions of the Provinces, were their papers prepared; the Marſhal <hi>Boüillon</hi> not oppoſing one Article, having been the Author of thoſe Propoſitions, which were put into the hands of <hi>Luſignan, Aubigny,</hi> and the other Deputies to exhibite the principal points of them to the Kings Commiſſioners, who, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome debate declared, that they had not power to determine any thing concerning them: But going to the Aſſembly, adviſed them to make their addreſſes by Deputies to the King, to whom they would do them all good Offices; which was concluded on. At the election of the Deputies, there happened a great ſtirre, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by the oppoſition of contrary factions, which made the Aſſembly reſolve not to draw up their Inſtructions and Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, before their nomination; that ſo they might either inlarge or reſtraine them according to the conditions of the perſons cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, who were <hi>La Caſe, Courtaumer, Ferrier</hi> the Miniſter, <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rande</hi> and <hi>Armet,</hi> who had no power to conclude any thing, but only to debate the propoſitions; and having explained them, to give an account of all to the Aſſembly, who would return them their reſolutions thereupon: This reſtriction pleaſed not all the Deputies, much leſs the Marſhal <hi>Bouillon,</hi> who now plainly percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that his deſign was broken.</p>
               <p>While they were preparing their papers, there fell out two particular things worthy the obſerving. The firſt was on the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral oppoſitions the Marſhal <hi>Boüillon</hi> made to an Article, which the Duke of <hi>Sully</hi> as earneſtly preſſed, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Aſſembly ſhould intereſs themſelves in his cauſe, for that they endeavoured to deprive him of his offices for no other cauſe, but of his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in which the Marſhal proceeded ſo farre, as an attempt to make the ſon renounce his Obligations to his Father-in-law, which he violently purſued; eſpecially one time going to viſit him being ſick, telling him that it was impoſſible, but that in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of thoſe great charges he had borne, eſpecially in that of the <hi>Finances,</hi> when he was Comptroler of the Exchequer, there ſhould be found ſome faults committed; though not by him, yet by his Officers and Servants; and that if the King ſhould iſſue out a Commiſſion to examine his actions, neither the Aſſembly, nor any other of the Reformed Religion ought to be offended at it; no, though the Commiſſioners ſhould do him wrong, ſince it would be by the ordinary wayes of Juſtice that he received it, and that he thought the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> ſo honeſt a man, a true <hi>French</hi> man, and ſo great a friend to peace, that he would be nothing moved at it. This ſpeech was but ill-received, and no better an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by the Duke, who told him, that the Duke of <hi>Sully's</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant ſervices deſerved a better recompence, than to be expoſed,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170346:9"/>
as a prey to thoſe that had diſſerved the State; that his actions in diſcharge of his Offices, free from all corruption, and miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour, could not, by reaſon of his qualitie, be inquired into, but by a Court of Peers; and that if he were otherwiſe dealt withal, all his kindred, and eſpecially he, his ſon in Law, with all their friends, would engage in his cauſe; ſo that after ſeveral Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, the Aſſembly proceeding to a determination of that Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, ſo much urged by the Provinces alſo, adviſed the Duke of <hi>Sully</hi> not to accept of money in lieu of his Offices, and eſpecially, not to quit that of Grand Maſter of the Artillery, promiſing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, that if for that end they ſhould uſe any undue, unlawful, and extraordinary procedures againſt him, they would publickly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that they looked on the Duke of <hi>Sully's,</hi> as the ſame with the general intereſt of the Churches, and of Juſtice; and that therefore they were reſolved by all juſt and lawful means to aſſiſt him: And of this the Deputies general had an expreſs charge given them in their inſtructions.</p>
               <p>The other was concerning <hi>Berticheres,</hi> one of the Deputies for the lower <hi>Languedoc,</hi> a Gentleman of quality, and of good parts, who in the raign of the late King, who was diſpleaſed at him, by reaſon of his practices, and intelligence with the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Montmorency</hi> Governour of that Province, was ſomewhat un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſomely turn'd out of his governments of <hi>Sommieres,</hi> and <hi>Ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guemortes;</hi> to which having in vaine ſought to be reſtored, he conceived this a favourable opportunity to make the Aſſembly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace his cauſe, for that they were both places of ſecurity; and, though they were in the hands of Gentlemen of the ſame Religion, yet he preſumed they were perſons, that had not given ſo great Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of their zeale for the good of the Churches, as he had done; and that though he had been conſtrained to accept of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for his Command, yet was it only for that of <hi>Sommiers;</hi> but for <hi>Aignemortes</hi> he never received any thing; and that ſince his ſervices to their party had drawn upon him this prejudice, it was but reaſon that they ſhould own the Juſtice of his Cauſe: And foraſmuch as he had brought with him Writings to verifie what he alledged, he moved the Aſſembly to appoint Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to examine them, and make their report to them, that they might conſider of them.</p>
               <p>It is to be obſerved that this <hi>Berticheres</hi> made a great profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of friendſhip to the Duke of <hi>Sully,</hi> who had done him many good Offices to the late King, ſo that he deſired ſome of his chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt friends for Commiſſioners, who made ſo favourable a report of his buſineſs to the Aſſembly, that in ſpight of the oppoſition made by the Duke of <hi>Boüillon,</hi> who ſtood for <hi>Arembures,</hi> to whom
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170346:10"/>
the Government of <hi>Aiguemortes</hi> was given, it was ſo well received by the Aſſembly, that the Deputies reſiding at the Court, were commanded to uſe all diligence in his behalf, it being a thing of general concernment, and of great conſequence. When he had obtained this, he goes to the Court, where he ſteers a new courſe, and to arrive at his aimes, promiſes moſt powerfully to aſſiſt the Court-party, upheld by the Duke of <hi>Boüillon,</hi> in the Aſſembly, and by this means got a quick and ſatisfactory diſpatch for his re-entry into <hi>Aiguemortes:</hi> Moreover in this journey he made the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble his friend, who embraced his cauſe with the ſame fervour, as if it had been his own proper concernment, and then returned to the Aſſembly: The iſſue of this affair ſhall be ſeen in its proper place: But let us now return to the general affairs.</p>
               <p>When the Deputies of the Aſſembly were come to the Court, their firſt diſpatch thence brought news of their fair reception, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially by the Queen, (who commanded them to put their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers into the hands of <hi>Boiſſiſe,</hi> and <hi>Bullion,</hi> Counſellors of State) and of the favourable anſwers they had at ſeveral audiences recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Council: But this was ſoon clouded by another meſſage from them quite contrary to the former, which informed the Aſſembly, that the promiſe to have their Propoſitions anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and returned into their hands, was now interpreted to be after the nomination of the Deputies general, and diſſolution of the Aſſembly: This highly diſpleaſed them who had already divul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged among the Provinces, the good hopes they conceived from the firſt intelligence the Deputies gave them: But, foraſmuch as it was a thing contrary to the uſe and cuſtome of the Kings Council, in affaires of all ſorts to ſend back the Deputies unanſwered; and that in all their diſcourſes with them there was no mention of any ſuch conditions, the Aſſembly unanimouſly reſolve not to diſſolve before they had received an anſwer to their Articles; which the Marſhal <hi>Boüillon</hi> ſeem'd to approve of, and promiſed his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt aſſiſtance to procure them a handſome returne concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
               <p>But there was a great difference between the Letter, he ſhewed the Aſſembly, and that which he ſent away, which intimated his opinion, that at leaſt ſome of them ſhould ſee the anſwers to their Propoſitions before their diſſolution: But the aſſiduous endeavors of the Deputies proving ineffectual, they returned to <hi>Saumure,</hi> where <hi>Ferrier</hi> in the name of all the reſt, made a relation of the particulars of their whole voyage, by which they perceived that <hi>Bullion</hi> was coming after with their Propoſitions anſwered; but that before his arrival their Majeſties deſired the Deputies general might be nominated; which notwithſtanding was ſuſpended.</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:170346:10"/>
               <p>When <hi>Bullion</hi> came, he confirmed what the Deputies had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, proteſted to many upon his damnation, that the Propoſitions were moſt favourably anſwered; terrifies ſome with threats, whiles he fills others with hopes; and to encreaſe both their feares, and hopes, he ſhews the Patents he brought with him for the augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the penſions of <hi>Parabere,</hi> and others, and the Orders to can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel thoſe of the Dukes of <hi>Rohan</hi> and <hi>Soubize.</hi> The Marſhal <hi>Boûil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> for his part, employes all his Art to winne the Deputies of the Aſſembly by hopes of a general deputation, and by the power he had to diſpoſe of the Tax impoſed upon the common people now raiſed to an hundred thouſand Livers more, the better to enable him to corrupt more men: The reſolution alſo of the Aſſembly to ſend new petitions to their Majeſties, that they might receive their anſwers before they diſſolved, gave him an opportunity to play the notable Polititian: For though there was a very good underſtanding between the Marſhal <hi>Boüillon</hi> and <hi>Bullion,</hi> yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended they a difference in their opinions; the one aſſuring them, that it would be but loſt labour to importune the Court any more; the other encouraging them to it with promiſes of good ſucceſſe; but his chief deſign was to weary ſome with delayes, that he might have the better opportunity to draw others to his party; and in the mean time covered all his projects with a pretence of zeale, that the ſimpler ſort having leſs ſuſpicion of him, might the more eaſily be intrapped: But failing in this attempt, he reſolved with <hi>Bullion</hi> and his friends, to perſwade their Majeſties to write a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (of which he ſent them a draught) peremptorily comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Aſſembly to diſſolve, revoking the Licence granted for their meeting, and declaring null all their paſt or future Acts: And foraſmuch as their Majeſties were informed, that all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties did not agree in this obſtinacy and diſobedience, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thoſe Deputies that would obey to proceed among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the election of ſix Deputies, who ſhould receive from the hands of <hi>Bullion</hi> the propoſitions with their anſwers; which Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was to be brought by one, that knew well enough how to play his Game. <hi>Bellugeon</hi> the Marſhal <hi>Leſdiguieres</hi> his Agent, was made choice of for this employment, a fit Inſtrument to execute ſuch a Commiſſion, being a crafty fellow, void both of honor and honeſty, whoſe ſubtle pate was alwayes buſied about things condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing only to his own advantage.</p>
               <p>Before he began this goodly journey, he takes his leave of the Aſſembly, falſly pretending, it was only to ſee his friends and kinred in <hi>Berry,</hi> and then goes out of the Town upon an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Hackny, but ſoon after takes poſt: which being certified to the Aſſembly, as alſo his treacherous practices at <hi>Paris,</hi> together
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170346:11"/>
with the calumnies he aſperſed the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> and his friends withal, he was by them declared unworthy to be re-admitted to this, and for the future to any other Aſſembly: But foraſmuch as he had the honour of being a ſervant to the Marſhal <hi>Leſdigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eres,</hi> they referred his futher doom to him. This cenſure infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely vexed the Marſhal <hi>Boüillon,</hi> who employed all the power he had to get it revoked, declaring that it was by his command that he had undertaken this journey, but all in vain; which ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed him againſt the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> that they forbore to ſpeak one to the other for a long time after.</p>
               <p>It was not long before the effects of this voyage were ſeen; for the Letter for their diſſolution contrived at <hi>Saumure,</hi> but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatched from the Court, came, and ſoon after <hi>Bellugeon,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that they ſhould now receive full ſatisfaction: But when the Marſhal <hi>Boüillon</hi> went up to the Caſtle, and ſhewed the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Du Pleſſis,</hi> and <hi>La Force,</hi> endeavouring to gain their appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of it, and the contents of it were fully underſtood by them, then were they filled with amazement and diſpleaſure; which <hi>Boüillon</hi> perceiving, he thought it convenient that <hi>Du Pleſſis</hi> ſhould impart the ſubſtance of it, to ſuch of the Aſſembly as he thought fit, that together they might contrive ſome means to compoſe all differences. <hi>Bullion</hi> alſo promiſes to deferre the delivery of the Letter, out of a ſeeming deſire to ſeek out ſome way for an acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation; and to that end deſires a conference with <hi>Du Pleſſis,</hi> which being yielded unto, after ſome diſcourſe, they agreed that in caſe they ſhould proceed to a nomination of ſix Deputies, and reſt ſatisfied with the anſwers were given them, he (although he had no Commiſſion for it) ſhould undertake to procure them ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction from their Majeſties upon the foure or five principal Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, as, concerning the Chamber of Edicts at <hi>Paris,</hi> Proviſion for Vacant places, the payment of the remaining part of Nine ſcore thouſand Crowns, and the reſtoring of thoſe places of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity were taken from us; and all this to be done before the diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Aſſembly; to which as <hi>Du Pleſſis</hi> was ready to make his report of this conference, <hi>Bullion</hi> ſent him word, that he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and that by very good intelligence, that there were ſome, who intended to take advantage of his diſcourſes the day before; wherefore he retracted them, and deſired he might be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to go into the Aſſembly to have the <hi>Queenes</hi> Letter read, and diſcharge his duty to the Commands he had received from Her.</p>
               <p>This ſudden change clearly diſcovered, that the end of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference was only to amuſe the honeſt party in the Aſſembly, the better to ſurprize them before any thing was agreed on, or that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170346:11"/>
they were prepared for what they were to do, either in order to their diſſolution, or the Deputation, and cheat them of the thanks and benefit of their pains: But both <hi>Boüillon</hi> and <hi>Bullion</hi> too, were not a little diſmayed when they ſaw, that when upon the reading of the Letter <hi>Berticheres</hi> roſe up, and ſaid, That for his part, he would obey, and that it was fit that thoſe that were of his opinion ſhould likewiſe declare themſelves; all of them with one voice cryed out, that they were more reſolved upon obedience than he, but that the buſineſſe ſhould be further diſcuſſed, when the Commiſſioner was withdrawn, which was accordingly done.</p>
               <p>But here it is to be obſerved, that notice being taken of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations which were commonly held night and day in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal <hi>Boüillon's</hi> Lodgings, by five and twenty of the Aſſembly (which were all he could draw to a confederacy with him) where <hi>Bullion</hi> alſo was often preſent, the reſt of the Aſſembly, to the number of fifty, with one conſent conceived it fitter to yield to the neceſſity of the times, than to make a diviſion, which would inevitably force them to accept for Deputies general, perſons whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly devoted to the Court faction, and that they were better ſeek out ſome other way to redreſs their evils.</p>
               <p>The Marſhal <hi>Boüillon</hi> perceiving that the reſolutions taken up by his <hi>Antagonists,</hi> had fruſtrated his hopes of procuring ſome creatures of his own to be choſen Deputies general, makes his applications by <hi>Proxy,</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> for his conſent to the reſtoring againe of <hi>Bellugeon,</hi> and ſharing the Deputation ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral between them two: In which the Duke of <hi>Sully</hi> alſo intereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelf, and ſo farre prevailed with the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> that he cauſed an interview between them at his Lodgings, where the Marſhal entreated him to abate his rigour towards <hi>Bellugeon,</hi> which he promiſed him to do: But as for ſharing the Deputation, he was ſo averſe from the very mention of it, that at the meeting on the day appointed for their election, the Duke of <hi>Sully</hi> openly blamed him for his obſtinacy, telling him that he would ruine all by his wilfulneſs: But the iſſue diſcovered the contrary: For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving aſſured himſelf of ten Provinces, he makes them agree to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the ſix Deputies that ſhould be nominated by the Miniſters of thoſe provinces; which ſucceeded according as he had deſigned it; for not one of thoſe the Marſhal would have promoted (to his extream diſcontent) were ſo much as named. Thoſe that were choſen, were <hi>Montbrun, Bertheville,</hi> and <hi>Rouvray</hi> for the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and <hi>Maniald, Boiſſeul,</hi> and <hi>Milletiere,</hi> for the Communal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: As for <hi>Bellugeont,</hi> though the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> no more oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him, yet was there much difficulty to revoke his cenſure; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170346:12"/>
times was it debated; at length, when a good part of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly were riſen, thoſe that remained, razed it out of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords: The Regulations for the Aſſembly were ſigned alſo, but the Marſhal entred a Proteſtation under his hand and ſeal, not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Miniſters for a third eſtate, or order.</p>
               <p>And hence ſprang the Original of all our miſchiefs and diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; For the Marſhal takes his journey to the Court, to receive a recompence for his ſervices, and revenge himſelf upon all thoſe that had oppoſed his deſigns, principally the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> who feared him leaſt, and had withſtood him moſt of any; wherefore he layes a plot to out him of his Town of <hi>Saint John d' Angely,</hi> of which he was Governour, and place therein <hi>La Roche-beaucourt</hi> the King's Lieutenant in his roome, alledging, that if he were once deprived of that retreat, he would be unable to attempt any thing: On the other ſide, the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> and his brother, at a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation held at <hi>Saumure</hi> before their departure thence, with thoſe that were of their opinion, concluded that every one of them ſhould give their reſpective Provinces an account of what had paſſed, and inſtigate them by particular Deputies to the Court, to make new Remonſtrances of their aggrievances, which they ſo happily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that in ſpight of the contradictions of the Commiſſioners appointed for the execution of the Edict, the years following there came to <hi>Paris</hi> Deputies from twelve Provinces.</p>
               <p>In the mean while the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> goes to divert himſelf at his houſes in <hi>Britany,</hi> and ſo to the Aſſembly of Eſtates of that Province; At his return from thence he was informed of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies laid at <hi>Saint Johns</hi> in prejudice of his authority; to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcover which, and alſo to apply convenient preventions, he ſends thither <hi>Haulte Fontaine,</hi> from whom receiving advice of the neceſſity of his preſence, he haſts thither with all ſpeed, and as he paſſed through <hi>Poictou,</hi> gave his friends intelligence of all, and ſent <hi>Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driere</hi> to <hi>Rochel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His unexpected arrival much daunted his enemies, who never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe ſent for <hi>Roch-beaucourt</hi> to come ſpeedily to their relief; but the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi>'s friends, flocking in every moment, grew to ſuch a number, as that <hi>Roche-beaucourt</hi> durſt not ſtir, but conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelf with giving the Court an account of what paſſed: Upon which information the King diſpatches away <hi>La Fontaine</hi> to the Duke, in appearance to know what was the matter, but in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to confirm by letters, and encourage the <hi>Partiſans</hi> of <hi>Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beaucourt,</hi> which the Duke, having treated him nobly, learnt out of <hi>La Fontaine,</hi> whom he returned with a faithful promiſe to wait upon their Majeſties, with a free account of all his actions, upon their firſt commands, which within a few dayes after he received;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:170346:12"/>
And preſently ſets forward to the Court, taking with him, among others, <hi>Roche-beaucourt,</hi> and <hi>Faucault,</hi> whom he greatly ſuſpected; and leaving in Saint <hi>John Haulte Fontaine</hi> with all neceſſary Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Inſtructions, that at his return, he might not finde his own gates ſhut againſt him. Being arrived at Court, he ſhewed the Queen by ſeveral inſtances, that he had behaved himſelf like an honeſt man at the Aſſembly of <hi>Saumure,</hi> and that he had oppoſed the Marſhal <hi>Boüillon,</hi> for that he knew, that he took part with thoſe of the Reformed Religion, for no other end, but to advance his own Intereſts, and render himſelf more conſiderable both of the one ſide, and the other, and that had he compaſſed his deſignes, ſhe would have been the firſt would have felt the effects of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance: But there were no eares open to his juſtification, (it being the conſtant humour of Princes not eaſily to be reaſoned out of opinions, they have been prepoſſeſſed withal) ſo that ſeeing the time for the Election of a new Major for the Town of <hi>Saint John</hi> drew near, and that his abode at Court was to no purpoſe, he pretended that his brother was ſick, upon which having got leave to be gone, he took poſt that very night; which fell out well for him; For the Marſhal <hi>Boüillon</hi> having notice the next day of his departure, was very earneſt to have him purſued, and brought back again; but he made ſuch haſte, as it was impoſſible to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take him.</p>
               <p>As he paſſed by <hi>Parc</hi> in the lower <hi>Poictou,</hi> he took <hi>Soubize</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him, advertiſed his friends in <hi>Poictou</hi> of what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, and went to <hi>Saint John,</hi> whither <hi>Foucault,</hi> a Captain of the Garriſon, whom he had taken with him to <hi>Paris,</hi> being ſent away from the Court, was come before him, and had ſecretly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled the Major and ſome others of that <hi>Cabal,</hi> to out the Duke of the Government, and for that end offered them two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men; which the Duke having notice of, preſently upon his arrival at <hi>Saint John,</hi> he commanded <hi>Foucault,</hi> who was then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three or four leagues thence, to return thither no more, and at the ſame inſtant ſent away <hi>Tenis</hi> to their Majeſties, to informe them of the juſt cauſe he had, not to allow the ſaid <hi>Foucault</hi> any more acceſſe to <hi>Saint John.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The time for the Election of the Major being at hand, which is alwayes the Sunday before <hi>Palme Sunday,</hi> comes <hi>Claverie</hi> from the Court with an expreſs, which ſignified, that by reaſon of the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Town, it was the Kings pleaſure, for the repoſe of it, and the avoiding of factions there, that the old Major ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, and that this precedent ſhould not for the future any way impair the Priviledges of the Town; whereupon the Duke of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han</hi> remonſtrates to his Majeſty, how that he was miſ-informed of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:170346:13"/>
the condition of the Town, and of what conſequence it was, both to his ſervice, and the publick peace, that, according to their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cuſtome, they ſhould proceed to Election of a new Major, hoping that this would be aſſented to, and for that reaſon ſent his Secretary with this letter to the Court.</p>
               <p>Now the Marſhall <hi>Boüillon</hi> rightly imagining, that the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> would oppoſe the continuation of the old Major, as a thing highly prejudicial to him, engaged the Royal authority in it to the uttermoſt, that ſo he might either ruine him by his voluntary ſubmiſſion, or by obliging the King to force him to a complyance; So that two dayes after the arrival of <hi>Claverie</hi> comes <hi>Saint More,</hi> a younger brother of <hi>Montauzier,</hi> and brother in law to <hi>Roch-beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi> with another, and ſtricter expreſſe to the ſame purpoſe: But the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> knowing, that his own ruine would aſſuredly be the conſequence of the loſſe of <hi>Saint John,</hi> conceived it leaſt dangerous for him to ſecure the Town, and feared not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe all thoſe Orders as prejudicial to the King's ſervice, and to proceed to the Election of a new Major, according to the uſual cuſtome of the Town, out of three of the Corporation, whoſe names were ſent by Deputies, conſtituted for that purpoſe, to his Majeſty, to make choice of which of them he pleaſed; and for the ſecurity of the place, the Keys were, in the interim, put into the hands of the firſt Alderman.</p>
               <p>The report of theſe things cauſed a great buſtle at Court; <hi>Tenis,</hi> and <hi>Onglepied,</hi> whom the Duke ſome few dayes before, had ſent thither, were committed priſoners to the <hi>Baſtille;</hi> his mother, wife, and ſiſters were forbid to go out of <hi>Paris;</hi> and Propoſitions were alſo made of drawing down an Army to beſiege him; On the otherſide the Duke, well knowing the power of his enemies at Court, and that he was to expect a violent perſecution from them, took great care to make all thoſe of the Reformed Religion in <hi>France</hi> ſenſible; that the hatred conceived againſt him, was occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned only by the reſolution and conſtancy he had ſhewed to the good of their affairs; that his, and the loſſe of <hi>St. John,</hi> would draw after them their deſtruction alſo; that if their adverſaries found this eaſily accompliſhable, they would not ſtop their courſe in ſo fair a roade; and then prepares himſelf the beſt he could to make a brave reſiſtance. But at length when all things were more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely deliberated, the King's Council thought fitter to commit this buſineſſe to a Treaty, and <hi>Themines</hi> was ſent to the Duke to determinate the difference in a peaceable way: The reſult of his negotiation was, That, for eight dayes the Keyes of the Town ſhould be left in the hands of the old Major, that they ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the nomination of three, out of which the King ſhould
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:170346:13"/>
make choice of one; and, that after this Election <hi>Roche-beaucourt</hi> and <hi>Foucault</hi> ſhould be permitted to return again to execute their charges, provided, notwithſtanding that the latter ſhould preſently quit the Town again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Themines</hi> ſent this agreement to the Court, where at firſt it was well enough liked of; but when it was communicated to, and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Dukes enemies, it could by no means be approved of: But <hi>Themines</hi> had orders ſent him, to inſiſt upon the return of <hi>Roche-beaucourt</hi> and <hi>Foucault,</hi> before the new Election, which the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> conſented to; and thus, for the preſent, was miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated the heat of this affair, though the perſecutions againſt the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> and his party continued in their former violence; eſpecially at Court, where the Marſhal <hi>Boüillon</hi> endeavoured, firſt to corrupt the Deputies, then to make diviſions among them; and laſt of all to deſtroy their authority: And when the Provinces ſent their Deputies to the Court to remonſtrate their reſentments of the ill impreſſions were given their Majeſties of their loyalty, to vindicate themſelves from the calumnies vented againſt them, and to obtain a grant of all their juſt demands, ſo neceſſary to their ſubſiſtance: The Marſhal <hi>Boüillon</hi> perceiving, that neither his confederacies in the Provinces, nor the Commiſſioners pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely ſent in to them, could hinder the deputations, turns now his whole endeavours to render their Negotiation fruitleſſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, that it was a diminution of the Kings authority to give audience to an Aſſembly convened againſt his will; that, if their requeſts were yeilded to, and ſatisfaction given them that way, it would diſguſt the loyal part of his ſubjects, and reunite the now disjoyned Provinces with the Complainants; and openly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering alſo great diſpleaſure, that they ſhould repay all his ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with ſlights, and envie; imputing unto him, upon all occaſions, what ever miſchief befel them: So that, though he could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their audience, he fruſtrated the contentment they hoped thence, telling the Deputies general freely, that what he did, was in tevenge of the affronts he received from the Aſſembly at <hi>Saumure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe things paſſing thus, the Marſhal <hi>Boüillon</hi> continues his ill offices to the intereſts of thoſe of the Reformed Religion in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and thoſe of the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> in particular; and having obtain'd the Ambaſſadorſhip extraordinary for <hi>England</hi> to get the alliance with <hi>Spaine</hi> approved of there, feeds himſelf alſo with hopes by the means of that imployment, there to procure a diſlike of the actions of the Aſſembly of <hi>Saumure:</hi> But the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> found an opportunity, by a Gentleman that attended on the Marſhal in the voyage, to give the King of <hi>England</hi> a true information of all things; ſo that as to that particular, the anſwer
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170346:14"/>
he received, was, that if the Queen ſhould be induced to infringe the Edicts made in favour of thoſe of the Reformed Religion, ſo that it were manifeſt, that they were perſecuted for their Religions ſake; his Majeſty required, in that caſe, that neither the League lately made with <hi>France,</hi> nor his preſent confirmation of the ſame, ſhould be underſtood to their prejudice: For Nature teaches eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, when he ſees his neighbour aſſaulted for a quarrel which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to himſelf, to foreſee what he may expect from the iſſue of it. As for his part, the King of <hi>England</hi> exhorted the Marſhal to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> to whom alſo he intimated his pleaſure in that particular: In reference to which, the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Synod then held at <hi>Priuas,</hi> endeavoured it alſo, and for that end, beſides the Deputies general, choſe <hi>Du Moulin,</hi> and <hi>Durand,</hi> Miniſters, and <hi>L' iſle-gro lot</hi> an Elder, whoſe care and pains in it were ſo effectual, that the ſixteenth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> in the year 1612. the Marſhals <hi>Boüillon,</hi> and <hi>Leſdeguieres</hi> ſigned theſe enſuing Articles, viz. <hi>That they would hearken to a ſincere reunion, promiſing to ſubmit their own particular intereſts to the common welfare of thoſe of the Reformed Religion, by an Oblivion of all past in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries: That they would freely renounce all reſentments, and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities againſt any perſons, and for what cauſe ſoever: That they would love and honour every one according to his ranke and quality, giving them upon all occaſions, all testimonies of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as far as the duty of true Chriſtians, and faithful Subjects of the King ſhould oblige and permit them.</hi> They farther alſo proteſted, <hi>that they deſired nothing more, than by a firm Union and concord to ſee the Kingdom of God advanced, and the Churches flouriſh in a happy peace, under the obedience of his Majeſty; and, moreover, to imploy all their power, that the authority of the Synods be not invalidated, nor the Diſcipline infringed; and that they would not favour, nor any wayes aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt any particular perſons or Churches, that by unjuſt or preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial means ſhould ſeparate from the Union, and conformity to the Doctrine and Diſcipline received in the Churches.</hi> This Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation was alſo ſigned by the Dukes of <hi>Rohan, Sully,</hi> and <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bize, La Force,</hi> and <hi>Du Pleſſis;</hi> to which they deſired might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded theſe following Articles; <hi>viz. To cauſe this Act to be ſigned by the Governours of all places of ſecurity, and other perſons of conſideration in the Provinces, and that by the way of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; and, that a Clauſe might be inſerted, by which they ſhould oblige themſelves to obſerve, as well all Politique, as Eccleſiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal order, and to reſtore and confirm the authority of the Deputies general in their charges.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But for all theſe goodly appearances, the perſecutions againſt
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:170346:14"/>
thoſe of the Religion, and the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> ceaſed not; which enforced them at laſt, upon the grievances of the Province of <hi>Xaintonge</hi> to call an Aſſembly of five Provinces, according to the regulation of the Aſſembly of <hi>Saumure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whiles theſe things were a doing, there hapned a new accident, which haſtned the Aſſembly: <hi>Berticheres,</hi> ſupported with the power of the Conſtable, the Decree of the Aſſembly of <hi>Saumure,</hi> and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of the Court, would needs repoſſeſſe his government of <hi>Aigue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortes:</hi> But the Province, advertiſed of his demeanour by <hi>Saugeon</hi> (whom the Duke had ſent thither purpoſely with a character of him) ſo ordered that affair, that, in ſpight of the Conſtable, they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained <hi>Arembures</hi> in it, and kept <hi>Berticheres</hi> out; which ſo incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him, that he made <hi>Saugeon</hi> a priſoner at <hi>Ville-franck</hi> in <hi>Roü<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ergue,</hi> which was more than he could do in his own government. When the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> and the Province of <hi>Xaintonge</hi> heard this, they avowed the voyage, and owned the cauſe of <hi>Sangeon:</hi> The Aſſembly alſo met at <hi>Rochel,</hi> notwithſtanding the ill uſage, and traverſes occaſioned them by the Marſhal <hi>Boüillon,</hi> who ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf more their enemy, than all the Kings Council beſide (notwithſtanding his engagement paſſed to the King of <hi>England,</hi> and the Deputies of the National Synod) and inſtigated the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of <hi>France</hi> to go to the <hi>Quetn,</hi> and hinder her giving any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable anſwers to thoſe of the Religion, ſuppoſing that ſuch ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor would force them upon extremities, &amp; would make them appear guilty of a deſire of war, and give him an occaſion to interpoſe as a mediator for them at Court; that ſo, he might render himſelf uſeful to both parties, and whatever happened, ſtill make up his own reckoning.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, <hi>Du Pleſſis</hi> tired with theſe perſecutions, from which he himſelf was not exempted, and fearing what the iſſue of theſe diſturbances would be, interpoſes for the compoſing of them, and comes to <hi>Rochel</hi> accompanied with <hi>Rouvray,</hi> one of the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties general, and brother to his ſon in law, bringing with him a draught of ſome Articles, not ſigned: But the ſucceſſe of his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation, not anſwering his expectation, he withdrew again, and with him, the Province of <hi>Anjou,</hi> (one of the five aſſembled) Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe, the other four continued well united, and by Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, deſired the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi>'s preſence at <hi>Rochel,</hi> to conſult with them about what was to be done: When he came, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, that they ſhould ſend a Gentleman to the <hi>Queen,</hi> in the name of the Provinces, to accept, for the preſent, the offers had been made them, referring the purſuance of the reſt to the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties general. But hearing, in the mean time, of the commotions at the Court, of a bold action committed in the aſſaſſination of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:170346:15"/>
the Baron <hi>de Luz,</hi> to the great diſpleaſure of the <hi>Queen,</hi> and violation of her authority; the Aſſembly took the boldneſſe to ſend <hi>Le Parc, d' Archiat,</hi> and <hi>Creſſonniere</hi> to their Majeſties, with proteſtations of their loyalty, and offers of their ſervice, chooſing rather to ſubmit to their pleaſures in accepting the offers made them, than to augment the preſent troubles by their importunities: <hi>Beſſay</hi> alſo made a Speech to the ſame effect, in the behalf of the Duke of <hi>Rohan;</hi> and all were well received at Court: Thus end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Aſſembly, which though continually traverſed, as is before related, brought more benefit to the Publick, and comfort to the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> than that of <hi>Saumure.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Articles</hi> agreed on (and pretty well obſerved) were,

                     <item>9. That nothing be changed in the <hi>Mas d' Agenois</hi> in the lower <hi>Guienne,</hi> and that <hi>La Veſſiere</hi> be replaced there.</item>

               </p>
               <p>Whiles the Court raiſed theſe tempeſts in the Provinces, it ſelf was not free from commotions. The Marſhal <hi>d' Ancre,</hi> who had ingroſſed the whole favour of the Queen, bred, and cheriſhed diviſions among the great ones, leſt their union ſhould obſtruct his advancement; ſo equally ballancing all parties, that neither could over-poiſe the other, and continually fomenting envie and jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies among them, leſt their reconciliation ſhould prove his ruine: They on the other ſide ſuffering themſelves to be hurried on by the violence of paſſion, rather than led by the calmer conduct of reaſon, ſo that all the Princes of the blood were ſeen in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition one againſt the other, and thoſe alſo of the houſe of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> according as their preſent enjoyments, or hopes of future favour moved them: But at length the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> upon the Queens refuſal to give him <hi>Chaſteau Trompette,</hi> raiſed a party of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, under pretence of reforming the diſorders in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the State; The Marſhal <hi>Boüillon</hi> the main contriver of this Party, managed it with ſuch artifice, that he cauſed the Prince, the Dukes of <hi>Longueville, Nevers, Maine,</hi> and others, to abſent themſelves from the Court, whom he himſelf followed the laſt of all, and with the Queens conſent too, upon the hopes he had given
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:170346:16"/>
her of reducing all thoſe Princes; And with ſuch dexterity hand died he the affair, that he became both the Author and compoſer of it; in which there was one very remarkable thing to be taken notice of, which was, that he imparted the whole buſineſſe to the knowledge of the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi>'s moſt faithful friends, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed it from his own, whom in other things he had alwayes tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted; for that he very well knew the corruption and falſhood of the one, and the integrity and fidelity of the other.</p>
               <p>The Prince with his Partiſans retired to <hi>Mezieres,</hi> a Town be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> near <hi>Sedan;</hi> The Duke of <hi>Maine</hi> who was Governour of the Iſle of <hi>France,</hi> with the Towns of <hi>Soiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Noyons,</hi> and the Caſtle of <hi>Pierrefons;</hi> the Marqueſſe <hi>de Ceu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres</hi> with <hi>Laon;</hi> all very conſiderable places, together with the Duke of <hi>Longveville,</hi> Governour of <hi>Picardy,</hi> with all the friends and ſervants they could muſter in their governments joyning to the frontires of <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> with the reſt of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents in <hi>France,</hi> made up a very formidable party; to which I ſhall not adde, that upon the retaining of theſe Male-contents from the Court, the Duke of <hi>Vendoſme</hi> being apprehended in the <hi>Louvre,</hi> and there detained priſoner; a few dayes after made his eſcape, and got into <hi>Britany</hi> his own government, where he made great preparations alſo.</p>
               <p>Things being in this condition, the <hi>Prince</hi> writes a letter to the <hi>Queen,</hi> whoſe contents were nothing but complaints of the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders committed in the State under her authority; that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the blood, Dukes, Peers, and Officers of the Crown were excluded from the Publick affairs, which were managed by three or four only, who to maintain their own height, ſowed diviſions among the Nobility, laviſhing the treaſures, and at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, diſpoſing of them, the Arſinals and Frontire Garriſons, which were intruſted in the hands of ſtrangers, who were in no wiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſible for them; that they deſired an Aſſembly of the States General, according to the Cuſtome, during the Minorities of their Kings, in which the <hi>Queen</hi> ſhould finde a legal proviſion made for the ſupport of her authority, the preſervation of the Lawes, and reforming all abuſes that obſtructed the adminiſtration of them. He writes alſo to the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> and all the Grandees not yet confederated with him, to invite them to a Conjunction with his Party; and to the Deputies general alſo, telling them that thoſe of the Religion were not forgotten in his Remonſtrances; He ſent alſo <hi>Le Maretz</hi> Lieutenant of his guards, to the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> to court him to arme in his behalf, proteſting that he would not liſten to any agreement, but with his conſent: But the Duke who on the one ſide knew very well the credit the Marſhal
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:170346:16"/>
                  <hi>Boüillon</hi> had gained among his moſt intimate confidents; and on the other, remembring the continual ill offices he had received from him ever ſince the Aſſembly of <hi>Saumure;</hi> and being not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jealous that the war was only declared in words, whil'ſt in truth they were already entred into a Treaty, reſolved to ſend <hi>Hault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fontaine,</hi> in whom he repoſed great confidence, along with <hi>Maretz,</hi> to make a diſcovery of the true poſture of the <hi>Prince</hi> his affairs; and in the interim made his addreſſes by letter to the Queen, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring her, that he would continue united with the whole body of thoſe of the Religion, to whom if ſhe pleaſed to vouchſafe ſome ſatisfaction, ſhe ſhould reclaime her diſcontents at an eaſie rate.</p>
               <p>In the mean while the <hi>Prince</hi> came to <hi>Saint Menchould,</hi> a ſtrong place within the government of the Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> which he had ſecured; and there alſo arrived <hi>Hault-fontaine,</hi> where, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a war proclaimed, he found a Treaty well advanced; He was received with much honour, and admitted alſo to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels; Upon his arrival, it was given out, that he came with an offer of eight thouſand foot, and two thouſand horſe from his Maſter, on purpoſe to haſten the Treaty, and yet was he ſent back to the Duke with an aſſurance that there ſhould be none, and a requeſt to raiſe armes: But <hi>Hault-fontaine</hi> aſſured him that the Peace was concluded, and that <hi>Amboiſe</hi> was to be given to the Prince, <hi>Menchould</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> and a round ſumme of money to the Duke of <hi>Boüillon,</hi> and that an Aſſembly of the States general was promiſed; which in a ſhort time after was performed: And thus did their own private intereſts intercept their regard to the conſideration of the publick.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Vendoſme,</hi> who, after his eſcape, had levied ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men in <hi>Britany,</hi> and engaged himſelf in the fortification of <hi>Blavet,</hi> was much troubled to ſee himſelf thus forlorne: He ſent <hi>Roche Giffar</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> with earneſt perſwaſions to joyne with him, which were well mixed with faire promiſes in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of thoſe of the Religion: But all could extract no other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer from him, than that the beſt counſel could be given him, was to digeſt, as well as he could, his dereliction, and in time, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, leſt his obſtinacy ſhould draw upon him an inevitable ruine. But this advice had no operations upon his reſolutions; though the Prince, when he came into <hi>Poictou,</hi> added his perſwaſions too, and endeavours to approve of his precipitation of the peace: The Prince was alſo very ſerious to ſee the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> who to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie him in that particular, came to <hi>La Roche des Aubieres in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jou,</hi> where he ſhews him, how he had been forced to ſhuffle up a peace the beſt he could, for that the Marſhal <hi>Boüillon,</hi> ambitious
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:170346:17"/>
of all the thanks and profit, had debauched and ſeduced moſt of his party (ſpeaking well indeed of none but the Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi>) ſo that he was conſtrained to accept of <hi>Amboiſe;</hi> That he hoped to procure an Aſſembly of the States General, in which his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty would be the moſt prevalent, for that every one in their Province, ſtickled hard for him; and that it was there, the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Kingdom ſhould have a redreſs, and the Nobility enjoy their dignities, or elſe that they ſhould have more forces, and a better pretence for a War; that though he had caſt off many Gentlemen and Souldiers, yet he regarded not that much, for that he knew, <hi>France</hi> was alwayes well ſtored with diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents.</p>
               <p>To which was anſwered, that the States would rather oppoſe his deſigns, and inſtead of augmenting, leſſen his authority; for that the fear of evil, and hope of good, the moſt prevalent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives upon the affections of men, were from the <hi>Queen,</hi> not him; and that the reaſon, why many refuſed to take Armes, though he commanded them, was, becauſe he himſelf did not, but had made his peace; for which he was upbraided both by the Duke of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han,</hi> and his brother; of which he excuſed himſelf the beſt he could, with many large proteſtations of friendſhip to them, and a high approbation of the Counſel they had given the Duke of <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſme;</hi> and thus was their interview terminated: After which, the Prince to make his advantage of all, wrote to the Preſident <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nin,</hi> that he had deſired a meeting from the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> for no other end, but to break off the confederacy between the Duke of <hi>Vendoſme</hi> and him.</p>
               <p>This being paſt, all parties were very induſtrious to procure a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of ſuch Deputies in the Provinces, for the States Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, to be convened at <hi>Paris</hi> the winter following, as were moſt devoted to them; And in the mean while the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen</hi> took their journey towards <hi>Britany</hi> to reduce the Duke of <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſme:</hi> When they came to <hi>Poictieres, Villeroy</hi> diſpatches to the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> one <hi>Villette</hi> (whom he knew to be a friend of his) to let him know, that their Majeſties paſſing within twenty Leagues of him, would take it ill if he neglected to come and wait upon them, aſſuring him of a fair reception; and that it was ſuch an opportunity to ſet himſelf right againe with them, as in prudence he ought not to let ſlip: Upon this encouragement he went thither, where, after a very good welcome given him, they engaged him to be preſent at the States of <hi>Britany</hi> to be held at <hi>Nantes,</hi> where all their propoſitions were anſwered with a free aſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

preſent himſelf before them, and wholly ſubmit himſelf to their pleaſures. This done, they returned thence, it being preſently after the Autumn, to <hi>Paris,</hi> whither a general curioſity carried every one to ſee what would be the iſſue of the States General. The Prince was in very good intelligence with the ſtrongeſt party in the Parliament, occaſioned rather by their hatred to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent government, than by any influence from his vertue or good conduct; for had his life and actions been in any degree propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to his pretences, and Remonſtrances, he would have much diſturbed the <hi>Queens</hi> government.</p>
               <p>Come we now to the States, who aſſembled at <hi>Paris</hi> about the latter end of <hi>October,</hi> in the year 1614: where all things paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed according to the <hi>Queens</hi> deſire, who notwithſtanding diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them, without giving them any ſatisfaction at all: The Prince was faine to yield up <hi>Amboiſe</hi> againe, which he had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten at the Treaty of <hi>Saint Menehould;</hi> and that by the advice of the Marſhal <hi>Boüillon,</hi> who thought by ſhewing the power he had over the firſt Prince of the blood, who only might lawfully que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion the actions of the <hi>Queen,</hi> to render himſelf ſo acceptable and conſiderable, that of neceſſity he ſhould be employed in the management of the publick affairs: But remembring that his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices had been leſs recompenſed than his diſſervices, and that men ſtood in awe of that aſpiring ſpirit, ſo apt and ready for any great undertakings, he reſolves to imploy it again to miſchief; and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king occaſion from the ill propoſitions made in the States, from the treacheries diſcovered there, by a pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The better to arrive at his aimes, the Marſhal <hi>Boüillon</hi> drew into the confederacy with the Prince all the Grandees of the Kingdome, whom either ſome particular injuries received, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy (the baſeſt, yet moſt common vice of all) had diſcontented; handles the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> ſo handſomely, that the greateſt part of them favoured his deſign, prevailed ſo farre upon the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Embaſſadour, that he incited his Maſter to countenance his party, and made <hi>Rouvray, Desbordes-Mercier,</hi> and <hi>Bertheville,</hi> Deputies General from the Aſſembly of thoſe of the Religion, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170346:18"/>
of great abilities, and good repute, his own; ſhewing them the remedies he would apply to the diſorders of the State, the advantages ſhould thence accrue to thoſe of the Religion in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and themſelves in particular; to wit, to the one the place of Embaſſadour into the <hi>Low Countreys,</hi> to the other the revenue of a Counſellor in the Chamber of Edicts; and to the third, the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation General; all very perſwaſive arguments.</p>
               <p>When he had thus diſpoſed his affairs, leave was granted for an Aſſembly to be held at <hi>Jergeau,</hi> the fourth day of <hi>April,</hi> which place was judged improper for a free debate, and attaining the ends propoſed; wherefore it was removed to <hi>Grenoble</hi> the fifteenth of <hi>July,</hi> one thouſand ſix hundredand fifteen, upon the inſtant requeſt of the Deputies General, and the Provinces, and the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance the Marſhal <hi>Leſdiguieres</hi> gave the <hi>Queen,</hi> that he would order all things ſo, that ſhe ſhould have no cauſe to feare the iſſue of it; which place, though the vaſt power, and well-known hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of the Marſhal might caſt ſome umbrages of ſuſpicion on it, could not however be refuſed, becauſe that <hi>Dauphine</hi> was a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, in which thoſe of the Religion were moſt numerous and powerful, and where without danger they could not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted.</p>
               <p>Whiles theſe things were in agitation, great care was taken to incenſe the ſpirits of the <hi>Pariſians,</hi> and with ſuch effect, that the Parliament ſet forth a Declaration, inviting the Prince and Peers to joyne with them in their Conſultations; which though they were checked for, yet deſiſted they not, but proceeded to the preſenting of very bold Remonſtrances to the King himſelf, whoſe ſubſtance was, that he ought not to begin the firſt yeare of his Majority with ſuch abſolute commands, nor accuſtome himſelf to ſuch actions, which good Kings, as himſelf, very rarely had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to, and after an exaggeration of the great and ſignal ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their Court ever ſince its firſt eſtabliſhment, and that all the weighty and moſt important affaires of the State were mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by their Counſel, or that the Kings had repented it, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the diſpleaſure they had to ſee that the Late States ſhould endeavour to ſubvert the Fundamental Law of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, by rendering the Soveraign power of the King doubtful, and problematick; that for the ſuppreſſion of ſuch pernicious Maximes, and that his Soveraignty which he holds only and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from <hi>God</hi> himſelf, be not upon any pretence whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſubjected to any other power, it were neceſſary to ordaine, that the Original Laws of the Nation, and the occaſional decrees ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on them be renewed and put in execution; and thoſe held for enemies to the State, that would ſubject the Royal Authority to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170346:18"/>
any forraign domination: Moreover they remonſtrate alſo how neceſſary it were to continue the ancient Alliances, and forraigne Confederacies renewed by the late King; that the King ſhould be alſo adviſed by the Princes, Officers of the Crown, and vete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rane Counſellours, perſons experienced and intereſſed in the State, and that none be permitted to receive penſions of forraigne Princes or States: That all Officers be protected in the diſcharge of their duty: That for the future no ſurvivances or reverſions of Offices be granted: That the Military commands be not Vendible: That the governments of provinces, ſtrong places, and principal Military commands be not conferred on ſtrangers: That for the conſervation of the dignity and ſplen dour of the Romiſh Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without derogating from the Edicts of pacification, and for the preſervation of the priviledges of the <hi>Gallick</hi> Church, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying the abuſes crept into it by means of <hi>Suffragans</hi> and <hi>Coadju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi> there be not ſuffered any multiplication of new Religious or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and that Biſhopricks be conferred on perſons of good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and ſuitable qualifications, both for age and vertue: That the courſe of Juſtice be free, and all obſtructors of it puniſhed; and that the Kings Council upon applications made to them, may not abrogate any decrees of the Parliament; but that thoſe who would ſue for relief againſt them, do it by the uſual and Legal wayes: That no pardon be granted to any Murtherers: That Edicts and Ordinances againſt Duels be obſerved: That the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the Kings Council be more ſtable, and not reverſeable upon every occaſion, either for money or favour: That the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and irregularities committed in the Chanceryes of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, and Preſidial ſeats, and Taxes raiſed without verifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Parliament be ſuppreſſed: That all ſocieties of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors of Eſtate, Intendants, and other Officers of the <hi>Finances,</hi> or Exchequer, together with all partnerſhips, be forbidden: That all publick gaming, and tippling-houſes be ſuppreſſed: That proviſion be made againſt the abuſes of treaſurers, and the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors puniſhed; and that the exceſs of rewards be moderated: That the Government of the Exchequer be intruſted but to a few perſons, as in the time of the late King: That the profuſion of the treaſures may be compued from this; that the Revenue is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter now, than in the late Kings time, who ſpent every yeare in buildings and other expences, now taken off, three millions of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and laid up two millions; that if thoſe five millions had been laid up every yeare ſince his death, there would be in the Treaſury twenty millions; beſides the fourteen millions he left there, which, to the great regret of all good <hi>French</hi> men, are now conſumed; extravagancies of ſuch a nature, as will quickly
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170346:19"/>
ſend <hi>France</hi> a begging, if not remedied; which cannot be but by a ſtrict inquiry into the actions of thoſe that have been guilty of theſe male-adminiſtrations, of which they know their Majeſties to be intirely innocent: Wherefore they moſt humbly implore their leave, to put in execution their decree made in <hi>March,</hi> one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſix hundred and fifteen, promiſing to diſcloſe to them things of great concernments to the State, which are yet hidden from them; by means of which, proviſion may be made for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of all theſe diſorders: But in caſe that the evil Counſels, and crafty Artifices of perſons intereſſed herein, ſhall hinder theſe Remonſtrances of a faire reception, the ſaid Parliament ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly proteſts, That for the diſcharge of their conſciences, for the ſervice of their Majeſties, and preſervation of the State, they ſhall be obliged hereafter to nominate freely the Authors of theſe abuſes, and lay open to the world their wicked comportments, that remedies may be applyed in due ſeaſon, when the affairs will more conveniently admit of them, and his Majeſty ſhall pleaſe to take better notice of them.</p>
               <p>This Remonſtrance wrought the deſigned effect, procuring the Parliament a ſharp check, and affectionating them ſo much the more to the Prince his party: Hence enſued great animoſities and very liberal diſcourſes of all ſides; and preſently after, came Letters from the <hi>Prince</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Queen,</hi> and all the Grandees both of the Court and Parliament, together with his Declaration, which reſuming the buſineſs from before the War of <hi>Saint Menehould,</hi> complaines of the irregularities in the elections of the Deputies for the States general, of the eluſion of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle propoſed by the third Eſtate or Commons, for ſecuring the life and authority of the King, againſt the deſignes of the Pope; of the exceſſive Offices and exorbitant power of the Marſhal <hi>d' An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ere,</hi> and his extravagancies in the adminiſtration of them, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming to deprive the Princes of their governments, and procuring Laws oppreſſive to the people, for the ſatisfying of his own ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, and ambition, diſpoſing of all the Offices of the Kingdome, as well Eccleſiaſtical as Temporal, infringing the liberty of the States, to which the Prince was forbid an acceſs, cauſing the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> to receive a ſmart reproof for their Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance; concluding the marriages with <hi>Spaine,</hi> without commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating the buſineſs to thoſe it ought to be imparted to, by ſuch pactices ſlighting and deſerting the Ancient <hi>Allyes</hi> of the Crown, and among others the Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> who, to the great diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>France,</hi> is ſuffered to be trampled in the duſt; cauſing a refuſal of the propoſitions made by the Nobility to the States, for the obſervation of the Edicts of Pacification; attempting to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170346:19"/>
the Clergy of <hi>France</hi> to ſweare an entire obſervance of the Council of <hi>Trent:</hi> That it was moſt unreaſonable that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal <hi>d' Ancre,</hi> the Chancellour, the Commander <hi>de Sillery, Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,</hi> and <hi>Dole,</hi> Authours of all theſe violent actions, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous Counſels, ſhould be maintained in ſuch an unlimited power: The Prince alſo further demanded, that before they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to a conſummation of the marriages with <hi>Spaine,</hi> ſome courſe be taken for regulating the Counſels, and reforming, and compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the abuſes and diſorders in the State: About which, he had ſeveral conferences with <hi>Villeroy,</hi> to amuſe and intrap him, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than out of an intention to contrive any remedies for them: At length upon the Summons given him by <hi>Pontchartraine,</hi> to the voyage into <hi>Guienne</hi> to conſummate the Marriages, foreſeeing thence the wrack of his hopes, and pretences of a good Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he declares that the Armes he had raiſed, had no other aime than the preſervation of the Kings authority, and the glory, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Nation, inviting all good <hi>French</hi> men, both of the one, and the other Religion to joyn with him, and all the Ancient <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes</hi> of the Crown, to favour him in ſo good a deſign.</p>
               <p>When the Prince had publiſhed this Declaration, he made his Levyes in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> and took his Canon at <hi>Sedan:</hi> The King alſo raiſed an Army of ten thouſand Foot, and fifteen hundred Horſe, Commanded by the Marſhal <hi>de Bois-Dauphin,</hi> to oppoſe the diſcontents, and with other Troops ſets forward to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Guienne,</hi> attended on by the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> who was to conduct <hi>Madame</hi> the Kings ſiſter to the Frontieres of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and there to receive the <hi>Infanta,</hi> and waite on her back to the <hi>King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time the Prince earneſtly ſollicites the Aſſembly at <hi>Grenoble,</hi> by his Agent <hi>La Hay,</hi> who delivers them his <hi>Manifeſto,</hi> and ſhews them the advantages would redound to thoſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, in caſe the Aſſembly would comply with him in reforming the State, and oppoſing the matches with <hi>Spaine;</hi> and further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages himſelf not to conclude any thing, but by their advice. The Prince his party, nor their adherents, durſt not open their mouths to ſecond this motion; But yet the others imagining that from ſo important an opportunity they might with good reaſon derive ſtrong hopes of obtaining ſome favour from the King, they depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Champeaux, Desbordes-Mercier,</hi> and <hi>Mailleray,</hi> to him, who found him at <hi>Tours,</hi> and preſented to him five and twenty Articles of greateſt conſequence to their Intereſts, humbly ſupplicating him to vouchſafe them ſome ſatisfaction thereupon. Of theſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties, <hi>Desbordes-Mercier</hi> was of the Prince his faction, the other two were of the ſame opinion with the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> who
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170346:20"/>
thought the firſt equally affected to him with the others; of whoſe abilities being very conſcious, he repoſed an entire confidence in him: He received Letters from him from <hi>Poictiers,</hi> which gave him notice of their diſſatisfaction, and urged him to a conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with the Prince, aſſuring him that the Aſſembly would be well ſatisfied with it, and alſo do the like themſelves: The other two Deputies governed by this, joyned in this intelligence, infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming him moreover, how much their Majeſties ſlighted the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, ſo that adding to this, the refuſal made him of the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivance, or Reverſion of the Government of <hi>Poictou,</hi> (to which his father-in-law had given his conſent) contrary to the ſolemne promiſes paſſed to him for it; together with the perſwaſions of his brother the Duke of <hi>Soubize,</hi> who was well affected to the Prince, he began to ſtagger a little: Beſides, in his return to <hi>Saint John,</hi> from <hi>Saint Maixant,</hi> where he had been to ſee the Duke of <hi>Sully,</hi> he met a Gentleman belonging to the Count of <hi>Saint Paul,</hi> who deſired his aſſiſtance to oppoſe the Marriages with <hi>Spaine;</hi> and was ſeconded by <hi>Saint Angel, Savignac,</hi> and <hi>Dora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,</hi> who in the name of all the Governours, and Nobility of the Religion, ſollicited the ſame thing, and choſe him for their General, confirming him with an aſſurance, that the Count of <hi>Saint Paul</hi> would deliver up <hi>Fronſac</hi> to <hi>La Force,</hi> as a pledge for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of his word.</p>
               <p>The accumulation of all theſe things, to wit, the hope of Redeeming himſelf from the neglect and ſlights lately thrown upon him; the ſollicitation of his brother, together with the deſire he had to ſerve thoſe of the Religion, overpoiſed his former reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſent him into <hi>Guienne,</hi> where he found that the Count of <hi>Saint Paul,</hi> with the Romiſh Catholicks, had made their peace, and a great confuſion among thoſe of the Religion; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, having gotten together <hi>La Force, Boiſſe-Pardaillan, Chasteau-neuf, Favas,</hi> and <hi>Pamiſſant,</hi> with others of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, it was reſolved, that they ſhould make uſe of the leaſure af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded them by the Kings ſtay at <hi>Poictiers,</hi> occaſioned by the ſickneſs of <hi>Madame</hi> the Princeſs, to prepare for a War; feeding themſelves with hopes to raiſe an Army of ſix thouſand Foot, and five hundred Horſe, which at their firſt Rendezvouz amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but to ſix hundred Foot, and fifty Horſe; nor could all their power ever bring more, than two thouſand men together; ſo that the King eaſily, and without any interruption got to <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> whence the <hi>Queen Mother</hi> diſpatched <hi>Cheſnay</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han,</hi> with very fair offers, upon condition that he would joyne with her: But neither he, nor <hi>Bois-de Cargois,</hi> who was depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Aſſembly with the like Commiſſion, could get any
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170346:20"/>
other anſwer from him, than, That he would not faile to make good his word, where he had engaged it: But this failing, the <hi>Queen</hi> endeavours to take off <hi>La Force,</hi> and <hi>Boiſſe-Pardaillan</hi> from him; As for the former, he conceived himſelf oblig'd to the defence of <hi>Bearn,</hi> and the other perſiſted in his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Rohan's</hi> chiefeſt care now was to engage in the party he had embraced, all the Towns, and Communalties of the Religion, together with the Aſſembly General, whom by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Meſſengers, he advertiſes, that upon the refuſal of favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable anſwers to their propoſitions, and the earneſt ſollicitations of their Deputies, he had now declared in <hi>Guienne,</hi> and his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Poictou,</hi> perſwading them to own their actions, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the Prince: The Duke of <hi>Soubize,</hi> who had ſtaid at <hi>Saint John</hi> during the Kings abode at <hi>Poictiers,</hi> immediately after his departure, makes his levyes in <hi>Poictou,</hi> and <hi>Kaintonge,</hi> and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly took the field with four thouſand good Foot, and five hundred Horſe, which were very opportunely ready to receive the Prince at his arrival there.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> conducts the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> towards <hi>Spaine,</hi> and brings thence the <hi>Infanta;</hi> whoſe voyage afforded the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> the opportunity to ſeize upon <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour,</hi> by the aſſiſtance of <hi>Fonterailles,</hi> who let him into the Town, where, when he was entered, he beſieged the Caſtle, and forced it to ſurrender, before the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, or the Aſſembly of the higher <hi>Languedoc</hi> interrupt his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign: From thence he marches to <hi>Verdun</hi> and <hi>Mauvoiſin,</hi> which he could by no means draw to his party; and thence to <hi>Montau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane,</hi> which, though with much reluctancy, he got to declare for him: In this March he met with the Duke of <hi>Candale,</hi> who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to him his intention of embracing the Reformed Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; after mutual complements they part, and the Duke of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han</hi> keeps on his way towards <hi>Languedoc,</hi> to the Aſſembly, who by reaſon they had not the freedome they expected at <hi>Grenoble,</hi> were adjourned to <hi>Niſmes,</hi> where his dexterous endeavours had ſuch happy ſucceſs, that maugre the power of <hi>Chaſtillon,</hi> which the vertue of his Anceſtors had acquired him; he deſtroyed all his credit with them, made himſelf be acknowledged General of the <hi>Seuenes,</hi> and ſo prevailed upon the Aſſembly, that all the oppoſition <hi>Chaſtillon</hi> could make in it, or in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> could not hinder their conjunction with the Prince; whoſe <hi>Partiſans</hi> ſeeing themſelves backed by the Dukes of <hi>Rohan, Sully,</hi> and <hi>Soubize,</hi> at that time carried all before them; and <hi>Desbordes-Mercier, Cruſel,</hi> and <hi>Novialle,</hi> were deputed to carry the Act of Union

to the Prince, and get his ſignature to the Articles agreed on: whoſe ſubſtance was,

                     <item>To procure a reformation of the Council, and an obſervation of the Edicts made in favour of thoſe of the Religion; and that they ſhould not deſert one another, lay down their Armes, nor hearken to any pacification, but by a mutual conſent.</item>

               </p>
               <p>At <hi>Montauban</hi> heard the Duke the firſt news from the Prince, though he had diſpatched ſeveral Meſſengers to him; and thither he ſent him word, That, notwithſtanding the oppoſition of a ſtrong and well-marſhalled Army, he had paſſed the Rivers of <hi>Marne, Seine,</hi> and the <hi>Loire;</hi> and that having gotten the ſtart of the adverſe Army, he was now marching to joyn with him in <hi>Guienne,</hi> deſiring him to march towards the <hi>Dordoigne,</hi> and for the ſecurity of his paſſage, poſſeſs himſelf of ſome places upon that River; which he quickly did, taking among others, <hi>Soü<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illac,</hi> one of the beſt paſſes on it, and beating up the Quarters of the Count of <hi>Lauzune's</hi> Regiment that was barricado'd in two great Villages.</p>
               <p>But the Prince, inſtead of that, took the way of <hi>Poictou,</hi> where he very ſeaſonably met with the Duke of <hi>Soubize;</hi> for he was very weak in Foot, and his whole Army ſo haraſſed, that had not the Town of <hi>Saint John</hi> received him, and the Duke of <hi>Sully</hi> at length, with much ado joyned with him, cauſing alſo all the places he held in <hi>Poictou</hi> to declare for his party, he would have been but in a ſad condition.</p>
               <p>In the mean while their Majeſties return towards <hi>Tours,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> commanding the Army of the Marſhal <hi>de Bois Dauphin,</hi> and the Duke <hi>d' Espernon,</hi> with another, having the charge of their conduct: All theſe conjunctions with the Prince, raiſed him from the contempt he lay under, to ſo conſiderable a height in the opinions of his Adverſaries, that he is now ſued to for an accommodation.</p>
               <p>Now it is to be underſtood that the Marſhal <hi>Boüillon</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Mayne,</hi> being more ſtrictly ligued, and of greater intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with the Prince than any of the whole party beſides, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently more ſought after by the Court, reſolved to have a peace, and purchaſe their own conditions at the expence of the whole confederacy: In order to which, a Ceſſation of armes is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on, and the Town of <hi>Loudun</hi> made choice, of for the place of Treaty; Invitations were ſent alſo to the Aſſembly General,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170346:21"/>
to draw as near to them as <hi>Saint Foy,</hi> where the Marſhal <hi>Boü<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illon</hi> was in great reputation: But the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed by his brother of all their plots, diſcovered to his friends in the Aſſembly the whole myſtery, and let them know, that it were expedient the Aſſembly ſhould inſtantly remove to <hi>Rochell,</hi> where their authority would be greater, and their ſtrength more conſiderable; and that for his part he was reſolved to go to the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though not ſummoned to it, leaving <hi>Boeſſe Pardaillan,</hi> in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to command in <hi>Guienne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before we proceed to the particularities of the Treaty, there are two very obſervable things to be taken notice of. The firſt was the Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi> his arming, without declaring for either ſide, but pretending as a Mediatour to enforce both parties to an accommodation, out of an apprehenſion he might give them to ſway the ballance on that ſide he ſhould incline to: A thing feaſable by the King of <hi>England,</hi> or of <hi>Spaine,</hi> but a ridiculous attempt for him. The other was nothing more Judicious, and that was a reſembling action of the Duke of <hi>Vendoſmes,</hi> who by the King's Commiſſions had raiſed a conſiderable force, but joyned not with the Prince till after the truce; ſo that, he ſerved for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to inhaunce the conditions of that party he declared for, and fruſtrating himſelf of all means to make his own, being of himſelf not conſiderable, attracts to himſelf the <hi>odium</hi> and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity borne to the whole party.</p>
               <p>At this Treaty there were preſent of the Kings part, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal <hi>Briaſſac, Villeroy,</hi> the Preſident <hi>d' Thou, d' Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But in the mid'ſt of theſe tranſactions, the Prince falls deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately ſick, which cauſed a great confuſion among them all, and made them more ſollicitous to have this affair diſpatched: The Duke of <hi>Sully</hi> was deſired to go to the Aſſembly, and repreſent to them the dangers, that attended the preſent condition of things, whence he returned, with a full aſſurance of their good inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to peace; which three dayes after, they confirmed by ten Deputies they ſent with an expreſs charge to ſupercede all former demands, that might retard the concluſion of the Treaty; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining themſelves to an obtention only of all expedients, neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to confirm and ſecure to them their former Conceſſions: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which were the continuation of the Aſſembly where it was, untill the verification of the Edict; the disbanding of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes; the reſtitution of <hi>Tartas;</hi> and the diſpatch of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners appointed to put the Edict in execution, according as the Duke of <hi>Sully</hi> had promiſed them in the Princes name; which he clearly made appeare by his inſtructions, when the Prince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded from the aforeſaid promiſe: But the King's Commiſſioners encouraged under hand, inſiſted eagerly on the diſſolution of the Aſſembly, which had like to have broken all, had not the Duke of <hi>Sully,</hi> pregnant in evaſions to prevent miſchiefs, firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſiſted in his endeavours to compoſe the buſineſs, offering another Writing to the Commiſſioners, which they approved of, and deſired him to procure the Deputies of the Aſſembly their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to it alſo, which, with the aſſiſtance of the Dukes of <hi>Rohan, Candale,</hi> and <hi>Soubize,</hi> he ſo happily endeavoured, that they aſſented to it, upon condition, that there might be an alteration of ſome termes; And foraſmuch as the Commiſſion of the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties was too reſtrictive, they joyntly ſent an expreſs to Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to the Aſſembly the neceſſity of terminating this affaire, and to that end deſire ſuch an enlargement of their power, as ſhould oblige them to ratifie what they ſhould conclude in their names, and with the advice of the Grandees of the Religion: The Duke of <hi>Sully</hi> thinking he had now finiſhed all, carries the ſaid Writing to the King's Commiſſioners, with whom were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Dukes of <hi>Nevers, Maine,</hi> and <hi>Boüillon,</hi> who all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it, and after them the Deputies alſo: But when he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with it again to the Commiſſioners, they denyed what they had done; but yet as the Duke was going from them, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called him againe, and after much conteſtation came once more to an agreement: After which they all met at the Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi> his Lodgings, who treated the whole company at Dinner; where the King's Commiſſioners, for the third time, ſo altered the Writing, that there was nothing left of its firſt
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170346:22"/>
deſign; for which reaſon the Duke of <hi>Sully</hi> would no more trouble himſelf with it.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the Prince cauſed the Grandees to be called to ſign the Peace; he was yet ſo ill that he could neither under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, when it was read, nor comprehend the difficulties yet to be ſurmounted: Nevertheleſs he called the Duke of <hi>Sully</hi> to know what hindered the ſigning of it, which being told him, he calls <hi>Villeroy,</hi> and having whiſpered ſomething to him very ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, preſently declares to the Duke of <hi>Sully,</hi> that <hi>Villeroy</hi> had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him the Writing juſt as it was at firſt deſigned with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and conſent of the Duke; and without expecting the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of the Aſſembly, or any reaſon to the contrary, ſigned it: Whereupon the Duke of <hi>Boüillon</hi> had many ſharp conteſts, real, or pretended, and deluſory, with <hi>Villeroy,</hi> for that he deſired that the Engliſh Embaſſadour, who had been a great inſtrument of the Peace, ſhould ſign it too, which the other oppoſed as a thing neither handſome, nor honorable for the King to ſuffer.</p>
               <p>This precipitate ſigning of the Peace by the Prince, occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned great and general murmurings among the reſt of the Party, that ſaw themſelves thus deſerted by thoſe that were the Authors of the Warre: And the Duke of <hi>Boüillon,</hi> to enhaunce the price of the ſervices he had done the King, bitterly inveighs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Aſſembly, branding them, and all that ſhould abet them, with the name of Rebells; offered to march againſt them, and declared that he ſhould eſteem for enemies to the State, all thoſe that upon any pretence whatſoever, ſhould refuſe to ſigne the peace; But neither his, nor the threats of the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners prevailed ought upon the others conſtancy. And becauſe this brangling was a diſturbance to the Prince, the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany removed to the Counteſs of <hi>Soiſſons</hi> Lodgings, where e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one, all other difficulties being cleared, to avoid diſputes for the precedency, ſubſcribed his approbation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and none, but the Prince, and the Deputies, ſigned the Declaration.</p>
               <p>But when all was done, this War wrought no alteration at all in the publick affairs, but what was procured by thoſe of the King's party, who made uſe of this occaſion to revenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon their enemies: So <hi>Villeroy,</hi> and the Preſident <hi>Janin,</hi> whom the Chancellour <hi>de Sillery</hi> had formerly put by, that he might have the ſole adminiſtration of all affaires, cauſed the ſeals to be taken from him, and committed to the Preſident <hi>Du Vair:</hi> But <hi>Villeroy</hi> nothing advantaged himſelf hereby; for the Marſhal <hi>d' Ancre,</hi> conceiving a jealouſie, that at the Treaty he held cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with the contrary party, to out him of the <hi>Cittadell</hi> of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170346:23"/>
                  <hi>Amiens,</hi> cauſed his Office of Secretary of State, to be given to <hi>Mangot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When this buſineſs was thus concluded, every one departed, but diverſely affected, and very ill ſatisfied one with another; and the next day came the full power from the Aſſembly to their Deputies to conclude the Peace. The Marſhal <hi>Boüillon,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Trimoüille,</hi> to inſinuate themſelves the more into the King's favour, engaged themſelves to the Commiſſioners, by an Act under their hands and ſeals, to rout the Aſſembly, and all that ſhould preſume to juſtifie them, in caſe they refuſed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, after the ſix weeks prorogation accorded them, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired.</p>
               <p>If the number of the diſcontents on the Princes ſide was great, it was not leſs on the other: The favour of the Marſhal <hi>d' Ancre</hi> was more inſupportable to thoſe, that upheld, than thoſe that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed him: and he alſo perceiving himſelf more tyranniſed by his creatures, than his enemies, made the late reconciled party believe he would enter into a firm and ſtrict amity with them; which the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> ſuſpecting, he alſo, to croſs the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal <hi>d' Ancre</hi>'s aimes, ſeeks after an union with them too: And in order to it, makes his applications to the Marſhal <hi>Boüillon;</hi> who fed him ſtill with very fair words, and hopes, that in caſe he failed of his end at the Court, he might have a good occaſion to intangle it in new perplexities.</p>
               <p>Some dayes before the concluſion of the Peace, it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the Prince his Council, that the Grandees of his party ſhould enter into an inviolable League amongſt themſelves, that two of them ſhould alwayes in their turns, reſide at Court, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt the others kept at a greater diſtance from it; and that every one of them ſhould embrace the particular intereſts of the others; The Marſhal <hi>Boüillon</hi> rejected that Propoſition, as unſeaſonable, for that, having occaſion to diſ-oblige the greateſt part of them, he foreſaw this might diſcover his intentions; and beſides, he was yet deſirous to derive his advantage from the merits, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of his ſervices: But after the Treaty was concluded, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf renewed the former propoſal, which was then alſo as unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, becauſe their minds were now too much varied from what they were, and they ſo jealous one of another, that every one ſteer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his courſe by his own particular intereſt.</p>
               <p>The Prince went to take poſſeſſion of the government of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> given him in exchange for that of <hi>Guienne;</hi> The Duke of <hi>Mayne,</hi> and the Marſhal <hi>Boüillon</hi> to the Court, to try how the pulſes beat there, but principally to reap the fruit of their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices; The Duke of <hi>Sully</hi> to his government of <hi>Poictou;</hi> The
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:170346:23"/>
Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> to <hi>Rochell,</hi> to inform the Aſſembly of what had paſſed at the treaty of <hi>Loudun,</hi> and to procure a nomination of good Deputies general: But the Court <hi>Caball</hi> being uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Prince his faction, and the hopes of favour, gratifications, and penſions, he gave to thoſe that ſhould incline to his will wholly governed them, ſo that <hi>Bertheville,</hi> and <hi>Mainald</hi> were choſen.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> ſeeing how he was hated at Court, and that the ſucceſs of all things thwarted his projection, reſolves to make an Eſſay upon the Duke of <hi>Sully</hi> for the government of <hi>Poictou,</hi> of whom when he had obtained a demiſſion of it, his Patents were prepared, according to the tenor of the Articles of the Treaty, upon condition that he ſhould go to receive them at Court, which he reſolved to do; and there delivers himſelf free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the <hi>Queen,</hi> telling her, that the ſlights ſhe had thrown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, had induced him to let her Majeſty know, that he was neither voide of reſentments, nor deſtitute of power; that, it was true, he had ſerved and obliged a moſt ingrateful perſon, which he was very ſenſible of, and that if ſhe pleaſed to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe him a pardon, and amneſty for his actions againſt her, and admit him again to her favour, he vowed that except the party of the Religion, he would devote his moſt faithful ſervices to her, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the world beſides; of which offer and proteſtation ſhe teſtified her belief by her acceptance of it.</p>
               <p>But to return to the Marſhal <hi>Boüillon;</hi> he employed the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt ſtrength of his whole abilities to gain an admiſſion to the helm of State, declaring that he was the only man could, at his pleaſure, rule, and diſpoſe of the Prince, who was alſo the only perſon could prejudice the authority of the <hi>Queen,</hi> and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently his ſatisfaction, and employment would free them from any further apprehenſions, whatſoever: But the Marſhal <hi>d' An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre,</hi> who had ingroſſed all the power, being the only Favourite, and intended to change the whole Council, to place therein creatures of his own, thought it not convenient to ſuffer the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of ſuch a one; which the other perceiving, ſtuffs the Princes head with new jealouſies, to prevent his returne to the Court.</p>
               <p>There were the Counteſs of <hi>Soiſſons</hi> of the one ſide, and the Princeſs of <hi>Conde</hi> of the other, that extreamly rejoyced at the report of the Prince his intentions to return thither; but all (ſo jealous were they one of another) agreed to divert him from them, unleſs it was by their means that he came; which he knowing very well, waved them all, and by the mediation of <hi>Rochefort,</hi> and the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Bourges,</hi> ſecretly made his
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170346:24"/>
peace with the <hi>Queen,</hi> fixing himſelf upon her, and to protect the Marſhal <hi>d' Ancre,</hi> with the excluſion of his own party; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he might be ſolely intruſted with the management of the publick affairs, and made Chief of the Council of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venew.</p>
               <p>Coming to <hi>Paris</hi> againſt the good liking of thoſe afore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, he was welcomed with loud acclamations, and applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and reſumed a great power in the State: The Duke of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han,</hi> with the <hi>Queens</hi> permiſſion, gave him a viſit, and ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproached him for ſigning the Peace, without expecting the Commiſſion from the Aſſembly; which he excuſed, ſaying, that he was induced to it by an apprehenſion he had, leſt the Duke ſhould hinder their granting it; and when he afterwards under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that he was reſtored to the <hi>Queens</hi> favour, he told him he was very glad of it, for that he had now brought no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions with him, but to enjoy himſelf, mind his own affairs, and no more to intermeddle in any factions, but entirely to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Queen,</hi> and the Marſhal <hi>d' Ancre:</hi> And when the diſſatisfaction of the Great ones, and principally of the Marſhal <hi>Boüillon,</hi> who was ſuppoſed to have an abſolute power over him, was objected to him; his anſwer was, That he now very well perceived his drift, and the ſubtleties he uſed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him, that the welfare of the State conſiſted either in peace or War, according as he was pleaſed, or diſpleaſed, and that he would no more ſtoop to that Lure.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, the Marſhal <hi>Boüillon</hi> though he ſaw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf quite caſt off, deſpairs not, but for fear of exaſperating him, covers the diſpleaſure he had conceived againſt the Prince, with a ſeeming approbation of all that he had done; and that his Counſels might be of greater validity with him, draws the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> with his brothers, and the Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> into an union with thoſe of his party; taking advantage of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and <hi>Pariſians</hi> hatred againſt the Marſhal <hi>d' Ancre,</hi> and by the means of <hi>Luines,</hi> who now began to be the ſole Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, expoſes him to the King's alſo; and communicated to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the prime Nobility his deſign to ſecure the Court by the death of the Marſhal <hi>d' Ancre,</hi> who had bartered away the King's Lieutenancies in <hi>Picardy,</hi> and the <hi>Cittadel</hi> of <hi>Amiens,</hi> together with that of <hi>Normandy,</hi> which the Duke of <hi>Monthazon</hi> had, and reſerved to himſelf the government of <hi>Peronne, Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didier,</hi> and <hi>Roye:</hi> The Duke of <hi>Longueville,</hi> enraged to ſee himſelf diſappointed of <hi>Amiens,</hi> and the reſt of <hi>Picardy,</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues his deſign, loudly proclaims to the world his diſcontents, and the Intelligence he held with the Town of <hi>Peronne,</hi> enters it, and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:170346:24"/>
poſſeſſes himſelf of the Caſtle, before any one could ſtir to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent him. <hi>Mangot,</hi> the new made Secretary of State in the place of <hi>Villeroy,</hi> is ſent thither by the King, but to no purpoſe, for that the Caſtle was already delivered: At his return from this ſucceſſeleſs voyage, the King, being adviſed to handle this buſineſs with all gentleneſs poſſible, ſends the Marſhal <hi>Boüillon,</hi> who made two journyes thither, but brought not back the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, was deſired; and indeed his own particular aime was to confirm the Duke in his conqueſt, to the end that he might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage him, and his friends, in the deſign he ſtill purſued. And one day, having aſſembled the chiefeſt of his Confederates, to conſult about the killing of the Marſhal <hi>d' Ancre,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Maine,</hi> who was ſuppoſed to the moſt zealous in the buſineſs, offered to kill him himſelf, provided that the Prince would be there, and that it was neceſſary to know his reſolution therein; the Marſhal <hi>Boüillon</hi> replyed, That they ought to beware of that, but that he would undertake to make the Prince avow the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on when it was executed, but that it was dangerous to impart it to him before, and that he ſhould not by any means have any notice of it, till it were ready to be put in execution, that he might not have leaſure to retract: But the obſtinacy of the Duke of <hi>Maine</hi> carried it, and the Prince when he was acquainted with what they had reſolved on, whether it was, that he feared the iſſue of it, or that for this once he would be a man of his word, that very Evening let the Marſhal <hi>d' Ancre</hi> know, by the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Bourges,</hi> that he could by no means abandon the Duke of <hi>Longueville,</hi> and that he revoked the promiſe he had made to protect him: Whereupon the Marſhal, the ſame night poſted into <hi>Normandy;</hi> and there ſeeing himſelf forſaken by the Prince, and many of the Great ones, combined to aſſault him in the Court it ſelf, contrived how he might prevent them: Informs the <hi>Queen</hi> by ſome of his Confidents, that the <hi>Prince</hi> deceives her, that the Marſhal <hi>Boüillon</hi> amuſes her, that many of the great Nobility were reſolved to deveſt her of her authority, and that the buſineſs was already come to ſuch a point, that ſhe had no other remedy left her, but to ſeize upon their perſons; on which ſhe reſolved, with <hi>Mangot</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Lueon,</hi> and <hi>Barbin,</hi> creatures of the Marſhal: And on the firſt day of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptember,</hi> upon a <hi>Thurſday</hi> at noon, was the Prince arreſted in the <hi>Louvre,</hi> by <hi>Themines,</hi> who for that action was created Marſhal of <hi>France;</hi> and that which is very remarkable in this, is, That up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame day of the month, and of the week, and at the ſame houre was he born: They thought to have ſurprized the Duke of <hi>Maine,</hi> and the Marſhal <hi>Boüillon</hi> there alſo; but the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:170346:25"/>
former lodging near <hi>Saint Anthony</hi>'s Gate, had opportunity enough to eſcape; and the other being that day gone to a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon at <hi>Charenten,</hi> was adviſed by his friends to return no more; ſo they went to <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> and his brother took the ſame way alſo; The Duke of <hi>Vendoſme</hi> alſo fled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>La Fere;</hi> The Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> who at the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of theſe commotions had quitted the Prince, was not how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever without his fears, when he ſaw him carried away by <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines,</hi> and that immediately upon it <hi>Saint Geran</hi> came to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after him from the King. This arreſt cauſed a great tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult in <hi>Paris,</hi> which was encreaſed by the Prince his Mother, and many Gentlemen, who animated the people of the Suburbs of <hi>Saint Germaine</hi> to plunder, and raze the Marſhal <hi>d' Ancre</hi>'s houſe, which they found ſo ſweet an employment, that the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage of it laſted two dayes; and indeed great prudence was it, not to oppoſe them in the heat of their fury: For the next day <hi>Crequi</hi> Colonel of the Regiment of the Guards, with one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of them, and another of the Citizens, eaſily took them off from the prey, which in the height of the hurly burly would have proved a greater difficulty.</p>
               <p>Their Majeſties gave notice of this Mutiny to thoſe of the Nobility that remained in <hi>Paris,</hi> and likewiſe to the chiefeſt of the Council; among whom, the Duke of <hi>Sully</hi> ſpake his mind freely, and declaring his diſlike of the action, adviſed them to compoſe thoſe differences by the intervention of the Pope his <hi>Nuncio,</hi> and other Embaſſadours, but ſo, as that the full pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to determine all ſhould remaine ſtill in the King, and the Queen his Mother. But this Council was diſapproved, and the way of ferce made choice of: In the mean while the Marſhal <hi>Boüillon</hi> ſets all his wits on work, to engage the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> ſomewhat further, offering to make him chief of a party, where he ſhould command all that durſt diſpute the place with him: tells him moreover, that what they did, was to reſtore the firſt Prince of the Blood to his liberty, and take the King out of the hands of the Marſhal <hi>d' Ancre,</hi> againſt whom the general ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred had evidently appeared by the burning and pillaging of his houſe in <hi>Paris,</hi> even before the King's face; that if they ſhould ſpeedily gather together their friends, and fire all the Mills about <hi>Paris,</hi> they ſhould cauſe a greater inſurrection there: But when he ſaw that theſe perſwaſions prevailed nothing upon him, and that he was treating for his return to Court, where he was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to Command the King's Armyes; he then moved to have him ſtopped; which the Duke of <hi>Mayne</hi> would not give way to.</p>

               <p>Thus all the Councils of the Marſhal <hi>Boüillon</hi> were rejected, though they were very good; For, in extremities, things will not admit of tedious deliberations, and ballancings of future e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents; and many times a raſh attempt cloſely purſued, meets a fortunate ſucceſs, when circumſpection (in ſuch a caſe) ever fails: Which clearly appeared here; for the Queen having drawn the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> and his brothers, changes the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of State, giving the ſeals to <hi>Mangot,</hi> the Office of Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of State to the Biſhop of <hi>Lucon,</hi> the Intendancy of the <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,</hi> or Treaſurorſhip to <hi>Barbin,</hi> appeaſes all popular tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, and by a Declaration, verified in Parliament, crimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizes all that had abſented themſelves; Raiſes ſeveral armies, and gives the command of that in <hi>Champagne</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> that in the Iſle of <hi>France</hi> to the Count of <hi>Auvergne,</hi> and having made <hi>Montigny</hi> Marſhal of <hi>France,</hi> and Governour of <hi>Berry,</hi> ſends him thither, who ſecures the Province, and makes himſelf Maſter of the Tower of <hi>Bourges:</hi> The Marſhal <hi>de Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vre</hi> does the like to the Caſtle of <hi>Chinon,</hi> which by the treaty of <hi>Loudun</hi> was given to the Prince.

with his ſpoiles, and at the firſt riſe advanced to greater authority; who by the paſs time, and delights he ſhewed the King in Hunting, and by his low ſubmiſſions had raiſed himſelf to the higheſt place in the affections of a King, who was then but fifteen years old: A Prince very ſingular, and jealous of his authority, which yet he underſtood not at all, and more apt to believe the worſt, than the beſt: It was a matter of no great difficulty to perſwade him, that the Marſhal <hi>d' Ancre</hi> aimed at a power would prejudice his, and that the Queen Mother was conſenting to it, that ſhe might continue the rains of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as in his Minority, in her own hands; For the inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies which alwayes accompany great Favourites were exreame in the Marſhal <hi>d' Ancre;</hi> and the Queen Mothers neglect of her ſonne too apparent: So that <hi>Luynes</hi> having before hand dealt with <hi>Deagent</hi> the chief Deputy of <hi>Barbin,</hi> who was Intendant of the <hi>Finances,</hi> cauſed him that night to entertain the King with a diſcourſe of the miſchievous plots were contriving againſt him; and out of hopes of ſome great advancement, he made his treachery againſt his Maſter the foundation of the deſigne: <hi>Marcillac,</hi> his Aſſociate, was he who had formerly betrayed the Prince to the Queen, and now betrayes her to the King: <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plans</hi> an ordinary Souldier in the King's Guards, had a ſhare in this employment too, for that he had been a ſervant to <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> who was brother to <hi>Luynes:</hi> In ſhort, in the contrivance of this deſign were employed only baſe and infamous perſons; but to <hi>Vitry</hi> Captaine of the Guards was the execution of it committed, who was commanded to kill the Marſhal, and for recompence, was promiſed to be made Marſhal of <hi>France;</hi> which accordingly he performed as he was entring the <hi>Louvre:</hi> At the ſame time were arreſted alſo the Marſhal <hi>d' Ancre</hi>'s Lady, <hi>Mangot,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Lueon</hi> and <hi>Barbin,</hi> and then were the Chancellour <hi>de Sillery, Du Vair,</hi> Keeper of the Seals, <hi>Villeroy,</hi> and the preſident <hi>Janin</hi> ſent for to reſume their Offices. After this were the Queenes guards taken from her, and ſome of the King's appointed to wait on her: A Gallery alſo that led from her Chamber to a Garden ſhe had cauſed to be made, was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down; nor was ſhe ſuffered, without leave, to ſee any thing, but the ſad converſion of her authority and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, into a low and deſpicable condition, and miſerable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude.</p>

the property of generous ſouls only to follow thoſe in their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, whom they honoured in their more proſperous fortune; The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> got leave to viſit the Queen-mother, the ſtrength of whoſe conſtancy was ſtill ſuperiour to the violence of her preſſures: And then, ſeeing himſelf regarded with a frown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eye, and taking ſmall pleaſure to ſee thoſe he had ſo lately fought againſt to be the only welcome perſons, goes into <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> where he arrived a little after the taking of <hi>Verſeil,</hi> and paſſing the Summer there; he ſaw an action worthy to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and related. <hi>Don Pedro de Toledo,</hi> after he had taken <hi>Verſeil,</hi> which had endured a long ſiege, to refreſh it, divided his Army into <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> and quarters it about <hi>Alexandria,</hi> a Countrey abounding in corne, and all manner of neceſſaries: In the meane while the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s Army recruited, and the Treaty of peace was ſtill continued by the mediation of the Cardinal <hi>Ludoviſio</hi> on the Pope's behalf, and <hi>Bethun</hi> on the King's; ſeveral conferences had they with <hi>Don Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro;</hi> In the interim of which, the Marſhal <hi>Leſdiguires,</hi> who commanded the relief ſent by the King to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to defend his States, but not to attempt upon the Duchy of <hi>Milan;</hi> having ſent to diſcover how the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army lay, made a propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to beat up the Quarters of two thouſand men, that lay in <hi>Feliſſan,</hi> a Village that was but ſlightly barricadoed, and ſeated in the middeſt of all the other Quarters: proving by many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that, though at ſifirſt ght the deſigne might ſeeme very hazardous, yet really was it not ſo, for that marching that way one night with all his forces, at break of day he beat up that Quarter, which hindered the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Armies rallying, and was the reaſon that thoſe he had left behinde him, having no retreat, were utterly loſt. This motion took the wiſhed effect; For the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> having appointed his Rendezvous at <hi>Aſt,</hi> marched by a private way, which avoided <hi>Nice</hi> and <hi>La Roque,</hi> and came to <hi>Feliſſan,</hi> which was inſtantly begirt, and forced, for they had no need of the Canon, which <hi>Shomberg</hi> Marſhal of the Camp, was bringing up with the Rear-guard, with which he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to take in a Caſtle, to ſecure the proviſions, which he did: The next day was taken a place called <hi>Quatordeci,</hi> in which were four hundred ſouldiers: The ſame day the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> gives the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> three hundred horſe, to cut off ſome Cavalry of the enemies, that were coming from <hi>Alexandria:</hi> As he was marching to execute that deſigne, he diſcovers 300. horſe and 1200. foot marching from <hi>Cazal</hi> to <hi>Alexandria;</hi> He makes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them with his whole party, but, notwithſtanding he uſed all diligence poſſible, he could not reach them before it was

dark, and that the enemy had ſheltred himſelf in a very advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous hold; A propoſition was then made for the incamping round about them, and ſending that night for two thouſand horſe, that might be ready there to defeat them by break of day; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this project might have taken; But the conſideration of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the reſt of the Infantry at <hi>Feliſſan</hi> in the middeſt of the enemies Quarters, who might eaſily beat them up, cauſed them to reſolve upon a retreat: So that after a dayes ſtay at <hi>Feliſſan,</hi> they marched towards <hi>Nice,</hi> which they ſurrounded, and in twice four and twenty hours, was the Town forced, and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſurrendred, in which were near two thouſand fighting men: The next day finding <hi>La Roque</hi> quitted, they purſue thoſe that were of the garriſon, who were all <hi>Switzers,</hi> whom they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took, and made priſoners: Thus in the ſpace of one week, were taken four thouſand five hundred of the enemies army; which being ſo weakened: and the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> finding himſelf to be more than twenty thouſand ſtrong marching men, had deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to enter in to the Duchy of <hi>Milan;</hi> when lo, from <hi>France</hi> comes the concluſion of the peace, with a Command to the Marſhal <hi>Leſdiguieres</hi> to get the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s aſſent to it, which he effected: But return we now to the affairs of <hi>France.</hi>

                  <hi>Luynes</hi> ſeeing that ſo ſhort a time had veſted him with the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire ſpoyls of a moſt eminent Favourites ſeven years toyle, having the ſole influence upon a young Prince of fifteen years old, whoſe Mother he had mortally offended, being himſelf but of mean parentage, and without any ſupport in the Kingdom, not ſtudied, nor any way verſed in State affairs, and yet governing all with a moſt abſolute authority, makes uſe of <hi>Deagent,</hi> and <hi>Modene</hi> as his chief Counſellors: And the next care he had, was to impoſe a Confeſſor upon the King, of an immediate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon himſelf, ſo to awe him by their ſuperſtition (a powerful engine to work upon the ſpirit of a young Prince) and to place about his perſon petty inconſiderable fellows, who amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him with childiſh toyes, and kept ſo cloſe a ſiege about his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that none could be admitted ſo much as to ſpeak to him in private: After this he cauſed the Queen-mother to be conveyed to <hi>Blois,</hi> where ſhe was moſt ſtrictly guarded: And then, that he might enrich himſelf with her wealth alſo, proceeded to the arraignment, and trial of the Marſhal <hi>d' Ancre's</hi> Lady; in which he uſed ſuch unlawful ſollicitations, and took ſuch unuſual cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to procure her death, that at her execution, the former ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of the <hi>Pariſians</hi> againſt her was far exceeded by their paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate commiſeration of her preſent calamities; cauſed <hi>Mangot</hi> to be confined to his own houſe; the Biſhop of <hi>Lucon</hi> to be rele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated

to <hi>Avignon,</hi> and <hi>Barbin</hi> was ſent to the <hi>Bastille;</hi> and then marries the Duke of <hi>Montbazon</hi>'s daughter to ſtrengthen him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with an Alliance not obnoxious to envie; having for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon refuſed the Duke of <hi>Vendoſm</hi>'s ſiſter.</p>
               <p>When he had ordered theſe things after this manner, he cauſed to be convened at <hi>Roüen,</hi> the moſt eminent of the Nobility, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the principal officers of the Parliaments (called the Aſſembly of <hi>Notables</hi>) that without parting from the King at all, he might put himſelf in poſſeſſion of the government of <hi>Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;</hi> where the diſunion of the Grandees, their infidelity, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſillanimity, together with the baſe and ſervile ſpirits of the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Deputies of the Parliaments, preſent at this Aſſembly, confirmed the Authority of this upſtart Favourite, ſo that every one yeilding to his yoak, he began now to think himſelf ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to diſpoſe even of Fortune her ſelf.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> who was now allyed to him by his wife, who was of his family, courts him too, among the reſt, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to reconcile him rather to the Queen, than the Prince, who from his Priſon had already ſent him Overtures and promiſes, that in exchange of his liberty, he would ſupport him with his aſſiſtance, and fixe him in an impregnable condition; He told him, that he could not long, keep them both priſoners; that he that was there before, his advancement could have no colour to lay his reſtraint to his charge; and that it was an eaſie matter to hinder his deliverance, that the Queens condition was different, who one time or other would eſcape from him; for though ſhe were kept alſo under guards, yet was it with more reſpect, and not as priſoner; and that ſuch guards were not ſo ſecure: He added moreover, that if the Prince regained any power in the State he would be a more dangerous oppoſite than the Queen-Mother could, that he was of a good wit, quick, highly ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and covetous; that though he was not of a vindicative nature, yet was he not obliging neither, nor had he the leaſt friendſhip for any one; that being not able to detaine them both ſtill in priſon, it was neceſſary he ſhould ſtrengthen himſelf with the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of one of them; and that however he had diſpleaſed the Queen, yet would ſhe prove his ſurer prop, for that ſhe was not ſo prone to intermeddle with the affairs, as the Prince was; and the jealouſies that were between the King and the Queen (which he knew well enough how to mould to his own advantage) would be his ſecurity againſt them both; <hi>Luynes</hi> ſeeming ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with theſe arguments, encouraged the Duke by all means to mediate this reconciliation; who having a ſervant named <hi>La Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,</hi> who was an intimate friend of <hi>Barbins,</hi> had by that means an
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170346:28"/>
opportunity to let him know the ſervice he intended to the Queen his Miſtreſſe, to which the Duke of <hi>Montbazon, Luynes</hi> his Father-in-law, was alſo much inclined. <hi>Barbin,</hi> (by the means of <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonville,</hi> Governour of the <hi>Bastille,</hi> where he was a priſoner) gave the Queen intelligence of what had paſſed, adviſing her to write letters to the King, <hi>Luynes,</hi> and to the Duke of <hi>Montbazon;</hi> to the firſt, full of complaints of vindication of her ſelf, and of reſpect; to the other two to do her all good offices to the King: the draughts of which letters were firſt carried to the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> who amended them, and corrected the acrimony of ſome expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in them: But the Biſhop who was to carry theſe letters, in who <hi>Barbin</hi> greatly confided, proved felſe, and moſt perfidiouſly betrayed the whole plot; yet, according to the inſtructions he received from <hi>Deagent,</hi> made he ſeveral journeys to the Queen, but with treacherous purpoſes to work the ruine of her, and all elſe that had a hand in this buſineſſe: But ſeeing that this deſign tended only to a reconciliation, and yeilded no colourable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to ground any accuſation on, they flie to ſubtilties; and in <hi>Bournonville</hi>'s name, deſire a Ring from the Queen, as a teſtimony of her acceptance of his ſervice, for that being brother-in-law to the Marſhal <hi>Vitry,</hi> he could not otherwiſe believe ſhe could have any good thoughts of him: The Queen, though ſomewhat ſurprized with this demand, yet could it not raiſe any jealouſies in her, for that the Biſhop who was employed in all theſe errands, was a creature of <hi>Barbins,</hi> made ſome difficulty to part with the Ring he deſired, as unwilling to give any thing that was not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of her, but promiſed to have one bought purpoſely at <hi>Paris;</hi> But he importuned her ſo much, that ſhe took one from one of the Ladies attending her, and gave it him: The Biſhop carries it to <hi>Deagent,</hi> who kept that, and cauſed another to be made juſt like it, which he conveyed to <hi>Bournonville,</hi> as if ſhe had voluntarily, and of her own accord ſent it him: After this they infuſed jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies into the King, that the Nobility had a deſign to ſurprize the <hi>Louvre</hi> to introduce the Queen, and reſtabliſh her in her former authority, and that all that were of the conſpiracy, wore a blew Ring on their finger, which was the cognizance of the party: And <hi>Luynes</hi> one day ſhuts the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> into his chamber, where he entertained him with diſcourſes, that the King was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly informed that he was alwayes much devoted to the Queens ſervice, that he knew all his machinations for that end, and the ſecret negotiations of <hi>La Ferte;</hi> but of regard of his alliance to him, he had prevailed with the King to pardon him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now it was fit he ſhould tell him all: This propoſition was with much diſdaine rejected by the Duke, who replyed, that he
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:170346:28"/>
was no Informer, and that he was glad they knew his actions which had no other aime than the King's ſervice; that be confeſſed he was a ſervant to the Queen-Mother, and that it was the duty of every good Frenchman ſo to be.</p>
               <p>After all theſe contrivances, and many others which never came to my knowledge <hi>La Ferte</hi> was taken priſoner, and committed to the <hi>Baſtille,</hi> confronted with <hi>Barbin,</hi> and both of them were brought to their tryal; and notwithſtanding the importunate ſollicitations made in favour of them, and were admitted of purpoſely to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle more people, the reſult of all was, the depriving <hi>Bournon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi> of the <hi>Baſtille,</hi> the perpetual baniſhment of <hi>Barbin,</hi> and of <hi>La Ferte</hi> for five years, who, notwithſtanding never ſtirred at all from his Maſter.</p>
               <p>Theſe violent procedures filled the Queen with great fears and jealouſies, and made her more ſolicitous to free her ſelf from this captivity, being now well aſſured that the hopes <hi>Luynes</hi> gave her of it, ſometimes by <hi>Cadanet,</hi> ſometimes by <hi>Modene</hi> were but only to amuſe her, eſpecially when ſhe ſaw that the negotiation of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noux</hi> the Jeſuite and the King's Confeſſour came to nothing; this Jeſuite made the King ſolemnly ſwear at Confeſſion, never to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like what <hi>Lnynes</hi> did, nor to meddle himſelf with any State affairs.</p>
               <p>The conſideration of all theſe things made her at length re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to work her enlargement; and to effect it, by the advice of the Marſhal <hi>Boüillon,</hi> ſhe made choice of the Duke <hi>d' Espernon,</hi> whom ſhe knew to be a man of great power, valour, and prudence: But he was diſpleaſed with her, and came to Court with full in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to ſide with the King; he muſt therefore be brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout; which the Queens ſervants deriving much advantage from the Favourites ill conduct, very dextrouſly performed: And firſt, they terrifie <hi>Luynes</hi> with the great power, and haughty humour of the Duke <hi>d' Espernon;</hi> qualities not tolerable by one who aimes at a general adoration: On the otherſide they exaſperate the Duke, who was of a touchy nature, and unaccuſtomed to a baſe and ſervile ſubjection: The firſt occaſion they took from his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to promote his youngeſt ſonne to a <hi>Cardinalat,</hi> for the which he was the firſt upon the Roll, and received all poſſible aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of it, but was put by, by the contrivances of <hi>Villeroy,</hi> who preferred <hi>Marquemont:</hi> But <hi>Villeroy</hi> dying immediately after, he continues his purſuit, with great hopes ſtill: But the Cardinal <hi>de Retz</hi> having made <hi>Deagent,</hi> and by that means gained <hi>Luynes,</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it; but not without obliging himſelf by promiſes unworthy a perſon of quality, with poor and infamous ſubmiſſions, which he ſtill ſo religiouſly obſerved, that being afterwards made Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170346:29"/>
of the Council, he ſeemed rather to do the duty of a Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to <hi>Deagent,</hi> than of a Cardinal.</p>
               <p>This was opportunely ſeconded by another occaſion derived from the Keeper of the Seals, <hi>Du Vair,</hi> who, hurried by his own pride, or the inſtigation of thoſe that were deſirous of new trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, would needs take place at the Council-table, of all the Dukes and Peers of <hi>France:</hi> The Duke <hi>d' Eſpernon,</hi> as the moſt ancient that was then there, complains, in the name of all the reſt, of it to the King, who took it ill from him, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the Gown-men, was preferred before that of the Peers of <hi>France:</hi> This ſtomached him ſo, that he brake out into many bitter invectives, even againſt the King himſelf; ſo that it was no hard matter to perſwade him that there was a deſigne to ſend him to the <hi>Baſtille,</hi> conſidering the late Preſidents before his eyes: The Queens ſervants, (who would not diſcover any thing of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions to him while he remained in <hi>Paris</hi>) ſo handſomely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved his jealouſies, that one morning very early, and without taking leave of any body, he goes thence to <hi>Metz.</hi> When he was there, <hi>Ruccelay,</hi> the chief contriver, and manager of the whole project begins with him, by moving a reconciliation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him, and the Marſhal <hi>Boüillon;</hi> and then imparts to him the Queens deſigne, with her requeſt to him, to procure her li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, with many large promiſes annexed to it, of which, in ſuch caſes none are ſparing: The almoſt inſuperable difficulties and dangers of this enterpriſe, together with the ingratitude, the uſual recompence Princes reward great ſervices withal, at firſt ſtartled, and cauſed ſome heſitation in the Duke of <hi>Espernon:</hi> But then the glory would attend the execution of ſo high and noble a deſigne, the indignation he conceived at the ſmall regard was had of him, together with his deſire of revenge, (paſſions predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating in all great courages) overcame all the ſuggeſtions of his fears: When he had reſolved on it, he proceeds in it with that caution, ſecreſie, and good Fortune, that having made all neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary proviſions for <hi>Metz,</hi> where the King, purpoſely to keep him at a diſtance from the Court, where he feared him, amuſed him with pretended and imaginary deſignes, he paſſes through <hi>France</hi> into his governments of <hi>Xaintonge,</hi> and <hi>Angoulmois,</hi> and there effected the Queen-Mothers deliverance, on the one and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of <hi>February</hi> one thouſand ſix hundred and nineteen, who came from <hi>Blois</hi> to <hi>Loches,</hi> a place belonging to the Duke, who there went to receive her with two or three hundred Gentlemen, who all conducted her to <hi>Angouleſme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This eſcape of the Queen cauſed a great confuſion at the Court, where it was conceived that her party was much more
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170346:29"/>
numerous, or that it might quickly ſwell to a bigger bulk; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore great preparations were made for war, that the enſuing peace might be more advantageous: The command of the Army to be ſent againſt the Queen was given to the Duke of <hi>Mayne,</hi> who was thought to be the moſt an enemy to her, and moſt faithful to <hi>Luynes;</hi> and becauſe it was conceived that it would be acceptable to him, to him alſo was committed the charge of the negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Bethune:</hi> Sollicitations were alſo made in the behalf of the Biſhop of <hi>Lucon</hi> (who till then had remained in exile in <hi>Avignon</hi>) for his return to the Queen, and inforced with promiſes made in his name, by his brother in Law <hi>Pont Courlay,</hi> to incline the Queen to ſuch a peace as ſhould ſhoot with the King's deſires, and alſo to ſowe jealouſies between the principal authors of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance; in which he failed neither of his endeavours, nor ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe. For <hi>Rucelay,</hi> who had as largely contributed to her liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as any one, left her in diſcontent, and drew with him the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe of <hi>Mauny,</hi> and <hi>Themines,</hi> who afterwards proved one of the greateſt enemies to the Queen, who found her ſelf but in a bad condition to engage in a war, by reaſon that many envied the gallant action of the Duke <hi>d' Espernon,</hi> few would ſubmit to his imperious humour, and every one believed that all would end in peace, and were therefore unwilling to imbarque in an affair, by which they ſhould gaine nothing but the King's diſpleaſure, and hatred, whileſt others carried away the glory of the enterpriſe: For which reaſon alſo the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> being ſought to, by the Queen, ſent her word, that he was much troubled that he was not privie to, and imployed in the beginning of her deſigne; which if he had, he would have ſerved her moſt faithfully: But being at Court then when ſhe made her eſcape, he was commanded by the King to his government of <hi>Poictou,</hi> to preſerve it in peace; that, for his part he would do her no harme, but adviſed her to make a peace, in which he was confident <hi>Bethune</hi> would ſerve her; and that being in full liberty, and ſecurity, ſhe would have more favorable conveniencies to raiſe a greater number of ſervants and friends than at preſent: <hi>Schomberg</hi> did cleare otherwiſe for to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deare himſelf beyond the other Zealots for her ruine; he laid a plot to blow her up by firing the Magazine at <hi>Angouleſme,</hi> which was happily diſcovered, and prevented. At length was a peace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, and near <hi>Tours</hi> was the interview between the King and the Queen-mother, to whom was given the government of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jou,</hi> and for her better ſecurity, the Caſtles of <hi>Angiers, Pont de Cé,</hi> and <hi>Chinon.</hi>

of the Marſhal <hi>d' Ancre,</hi> after which <hi>Du Vair,</hi> Keeper of the Seals, being reſtored to his Office; upon the ſollicitations of the Biſhops of <hi>Bearn,</hi> and imagining he ſhould do ſo eminent an action, as would gaine him ſuch reputation at <hi>Rome,</hi> would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance him to the dignity of a Cardinal, he procured an order of the King's Council, for reſtoring to the Eccleſiaſtiques of that Countrey their goods that were formerly aliened by authority, and had for fourty, or fifty years been imployed for the maintenance of their Miniſters, Academy, and the Garriſon in the Fort cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Navarrins. La Force,</hi> then Governour of that Countrey, was at Court at the ſame time, and mainly oppoſed the Order, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the difficulties would obſtruct it, and the inconveniencies might ariſe from it; which I conceive he did with very ſincere in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions: But being over-powered, turns his deſires to his own private advantage, and promiſes to promote the execution of it, upon condition he might be made Marſhal of <hi>France,</hi> which was promiſed him: But either the difficulties he met with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, or rage to ſee himſelf laughed at at Court, made him reſolve to ſtand it out againſt all; In which he met with great oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Countrey, occaſioned by thoſe of the houſe of <hi>Benac,</hi> backed with the Count of <hi>Grammond,</hi> his deadly enemies, and by the politick practices of the Court, ſo that he was now hated by all parties for not doing what he might for the ſatisfaction of either.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> who was his friend, patronized him ſtill at Court, and, ſeeing that the Kings Commiſſioner <hi>Renard</hi> caſt all the blame of the ill ſucceſſe he had in his voyage upon <hi>La Force,</hi> uſed all means poſſible to compoſe the buſineſſe, ſhewing that if the Province of <hi>Bearn</hi> ſhould addreſſe themſelves to the Reformed Churches of <hi>France,</hi> their particular might grow into a general cauſe, from whoſe circumſtances might arrive ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents not eaſie to be remedied, and that it was the wiſeſt courſe to quench this fire before it were throughly kindled: That it was moſt reaſonable (ſince the thing was begun) that the King ſhould receive ſatisfaction, and the Countrey alſo ſhould be ſecured; and that partial perſons were moſt unfit to be imployed in it: Theſe reaſons were the better reliſhed, for that they already began to diſcover ſeveral Aſſemblies in the Provinces, and to fear the event of them: And now were things in ſo fair a way, that the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> had obtained a re-imburſement of the like ſum of money reſtored to the Eccleſiaſtiques, to be had out of the next receipts; and in caſe of non-payment, permiſſion was granted to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey to ſeize again upon the goods of the Eccleſiaſtiques. But for as much as <hi>La Force</hi> found not his advantages in this accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170346:30"/>
he was eaſily induced to reject it, complaining to the Court, that to diſcredit him thus, was the way to diſable him for any future ſervices, and to thoſe of the Religion, that it was an introduction to the ruine of the Reformed Religion in their Country: And notwithſtanding that all the Churches of <hi>France,</hi> were, upon good deliberation, ſatisfied with this agreement, yet never could the people be induced to it, ſo that the diſpute laſted till the Convocation of the General Aſſembly of thoſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion at <hi>Loudun,</hi> the three and twentieth of <hi>May,</hi> one thouſand ſix hundred and nineteen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Luynes</hi> in the mean time did all the ill offices he could to the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> endeavoured to criminalize him, for buying the government of <hi>Maillezais,</hi> of <hi>Aubigny,</hi> and of a private houſe in <hi>Poictou</hi> which was very ſtrong, and which he compelled him to pull down; having, but a little before it was razed, engaged ſome in an attempt to ſurprize it; and though thoſe that had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken it, were taken as they were teady to put their deſigne in execution, yet ordered he things ſo, that he could not have ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice done upon them: After this, having releaſed the Prince from the <hi>Bastille,</hi> to ſtrengthen himſelf with his power againſt the Queen, and the Prince declaring himſelf an open enemy to the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> the Duke reſolves to adhere entirely to the Queens ſervice, of which he went to <hi>Angiers</hi> to aſſure her; and underſtanding of the party was raiſing for her, he adviſed her not to ſtay there, but to remove to <hi>Bourdeaux;</hi> that her moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſervants were the Dukes of <hi>Mayne, Espernon,</hi> and <hi>Rohan;</hi> that being there, ſhe would have a powerful Parliament to declare for her, and that there ſhe was ſecure from any invaſion before ſhe had an army ready to diſpute the field; that if ſhe ſtayed at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers,</hi> and that if <hi>Pont de Cé</hi> were taken from her, ſhe and her whole Party would be loſt without one blow ſtriking: that ſhe ought to give the greater confidence to this Council, becauſe it was to his own diſadvantage, for that being ſo near the King, he was like to be the firſt would ſuffer.</p>
               <p>To this ſhe anſwered, That ſhe much approved of his Reaſons, but that if ſhe ſhould follow his advice, it would give the Duke <hi>d' Espernon</hi> ſuſpitions that ſhe intended to put herſelf wholly into the hands of the Duke of <hi>Mayne:</hi> Beſides, the hopes the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſe of <hi>Soiſſons</hi> gave her from <hi>Normandy,</hi> built upon her Sonne-in-law the Duke of <hi>Longueville,</hi> who was lately made Governour of that Province, and was Maſter of <hi>Dieppe,</hi> and the Grand <hi>Prior</hi> who held <hi>Caen,</hi> and both of them had great correſpondences in <hi>Roüen,</hi> prevailed ſo upon her, that ſhe would by no means budge from <hi>Angiers:</hi> But deſired that the Aſſembly at <hi>Loudun</hi> might be

continued, which might have been effected, but then it muſt have been by making ſuch a diviſion as at <hi>Saumure;</hi> when the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> had conferred about it with the chiefeſt friends he had in the Aſſembly, and among others, with the Count of <hi>Orval,</hi> his brother-in-Law, who was very powerful among them, they concluded to accept of what the King offered, <hi>viz.</hi> With in ſix moneths to give the Aſſembly ſatisfaction in the affair of <hi>Bearn,</hi> and the reſtitution of <hi>Lectoure,</hi> one of their cautionary Towns, which if not performed, then ſhould the Aſſembly convene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain within one moneth after, and that at <hi>Rochel:</hi> This very well pleaſed the Queen, to whom it was farther manifeſted, that this new Convocation, being in ſpight of the Court, to be in the moſt conſiderable Town of their party, where none but the moſt reſolute would come, would firmly binde the Aſſembly to her, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with all the Reformed Churches in the Kingdom; But withal they deſired her, that in caſe any peace was made, they might be ſatisfied concerning their two demands touching <hi>Bearn,</hi> and <hi>Lectoure,</hi> which ſhe promiſed.</p>
               <p>Now, ſo violent and tyrannical was the government of <hi>Luynes,</hi> that it had wearied all the world, and even his beſt friends alſo, as the Duke of <hi>Maine;</hi> for whom, a little before, he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the Government of <hi>Guienne,</hi> in exchange for that of the Iſle of <hi>France;</hi> and not ſatisfied with this, he gives it to the Duke of <hi>Monthazon</hi> his father-in-law and ſeizes upon that of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardy</hi> with all the Fortreſſes there, and in lieu of it gives that of <hi>Normandy</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Longueville.</hi> Moreover, he and his two brothers were made Dukes, and Peers of <hi>France;</hi> and all vacant Offices, Eccleſiaſtical Benefices, and Penſions were ingroſſed by theſe three brethren, and diſtributed among their poor kindred that flocked in to them, from the parts about <hi>Avignon:</hi> So that jealouſie, and envie, together with the bad adminiſtration of the publique affairs had rendred them ſo odious, that every one betook himſelf to the Queens party; Even the Prince of <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> to whoſe marriage with <hi>Madam</hi> the King's ſiſter, he had not long before occaſioned; <hi>Luynes</hi> ſeeing himſelf charged on every ſide, but ſupported by the Prince, perſwades the King to prevent the Queen his Mother; and whiles by divers meſſengers, he entertains her with hopes of an Accommodation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and corrupts, and ſeduces her followers, he makes freſh levies of ſouldiers; which ſhe perceiving, does the like, and by the Vicount <hi>Sardigny</hi> ſends a letter to his Majeſty to let him know, how ſhe is conſtrained to provide for the ſecurity of her perſon, to ſave her ſelf from the fury of her enemies, who abuſing his authority, imploy it to ruine her. This, with the advice of the Prince, haſtens the King
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170346:31"/>
into <hi>Normandy,</hi> to ſecure that Province, which was in a tottering condition, and much enclined to the Queen; but his Preſence, though accompanied with but a ſmall force, ſoon ſettled all: <hi>Rouen</hi> is ſecured, <hi>Caën</hi> yeilded, <hi>Alencon</hi> alſo, and all the Nobility ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. This happy and unexpected ſucceſſe makes him proceed to <hi>Mans,</hi> and thence ſtraight to <hi>Aagiers;</hi> Great was the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion this cauſed in the other party, eſpecially in the Biſhop of <hi>Lucon,</hi> who not ſuffering the Queen-mother to go where her greateſt forces lay, for fear leſt ſhe ſhould get out of his tuition, makes her reſolve upon a pitiful defence in a town of no conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and an enemy to her party, that ſo intangling her in a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of ſubmitting to an inglorious Accommodation, he might make his own peace upon better termes; which he did, and from that time he ever held intelligence with the King's party. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the Duke of <hi>Retz,</hi> whether it was, that his Uncle the Cardinal <hi>de Retz</hi> had gained him before, or whether his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the danger had altered his mind, moſt certain it is, that ſeeing the King's forces ready to fall on upon the works of <hi>Pont de Cé,</hi> of which he had undertaken the defence, upon an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary diſcontent that a peace was concluding without his privity, he ſuddenly quits them, and with all his troops repaſſes the <hi>Loire;</hi> Thus was <hi>Pont de Cé</hi> taken, and the Queen who had thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand good men ready in <hi>Guienne, Poictoa, Xaintonge,</hi> and <hi>Angou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mois,</hi> was vanquiſhed by five or ſix thouſand only, and reduced to a neceſſity of accepting ſuch Articles as her enemies pleaſed to vouchſafe her; according to which, and her own particular order, the Dukes of <hi>Maine, d' Eſpernon, Rohan,</hi> and <hi>Soubize</hi> laid down their Armes.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>ND now are we arrived at the ſourſe of all our evils, and fatal commencement of the Warres againſt thoſe of the Reformed Religion. The King, having thus happily put a period to this War, goes to <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> where he ſuppreſſes the authority of the Duke of <hi>Maine,</hi> and commands the <hi>Bearnois</hi> that the late Decree be put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But they, neither knowing how to obey him, nor deſend themſelves, oblige him in perſon to a voyage into <hi>Bearn:</hi> And there it was they firſt began to ſlight and laugh at the performance of their parol engagements; For the next day after their arrival, and a ſolemne promiſe made to the <hi>Bearnois</hi> to preſerve their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges entire, were they totally deveſted of them, by the re-uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170346:33"/>
of <hi>Beane</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> and changing, contrary to the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their faith given the Governour of <hi>Navarrins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover it is to be known, that the Deputy general <hi>Favas,</hi> who was in purſuit of the government of <hi>Lectour</hi> in the behalf of his ſon, the more to induce the Court to yeild to his requeſt, threatned to ſend to thoſe at <hi>Rochel</hi> to convene the Aſſembly ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, according to the power given them by the Aſſembly at <hi>Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dun:</hi> But ſeeing, that prevailed not to compaſſe his deſigne, and not conſidering how unſeaſonable it was, he writes to thoſe of <hi>Rochel,</hi> from <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> to cauſe the ſaid Convention, adviſing them alſo to repair their fortifications; And thus are the publique continually ſwallowed up by private Intereſts.</p>
               <p>When the King was returned to <hi>Paris,</hi> the Aſſembly general meets at <hi>Rochel,</hi> and <hi>Favas</hi> ſtill followes the Court, to finde ſome means to accompliſh his deſires; His Majeſty in the firſt place, forbids the holding of the ſaid Aſſembly, next commands their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and laſtly declares them Traytors: The chief of thoſe of the Religion, conceiving that great prejudice to them would attend their obſtinacy, were of opinion that they were beſt to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve upon certain conditions, of which they had hopes given them from the Court: But the Letters which <hi>Favas</hi> ſent thence, together with the particular diſcontents of <hi>La Force,</hi> and <hi>Chastil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> by reaſon of the hard uſage the one received in his Offices, and a deſire the other had to have more, occaſioned the continuance of the Aſſembly; whence the King took a pretence to proſecute his deſignes to the uttermoſt, to which, the baſeneſſe, and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery of the Governours of the Cautionary Towns facilitated his acceſſe.</p>
               <p>It is to be obſerved, that before the Kings departure from <hi>Paris,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Nevers</hi> and <hi>Maine</hi> were in great diſcontent retired into <hi>Champegne,</hi> and the Count of <hi>Soiſſons</hi> to <hi>Frontevault:</hi> The Duke <hi>de Luynes,</hi> that he might not leave ſuch thorns in his back, was very deſirous to reconcile them; and to move them to it, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vas</hi> was ſent to informe the Dukes, that he was now going to the Aſſembly with full ſatisfaction to all their demands, and that it would be prudence in them to comply, before the determination of that affair; the like ſpeech was made to the Count of <hi>Soiſſons</hi> by <hi>Villarnoul,</hi> which wrought all their returns to the Court, and occaſioned the reconciliation between the Cardinal <hi>de Guiſe,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Nevers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the reducing of theſe Princes, the aſſurance <hi>Villarnoul</hi> gave of <hi>Saumure,</hi> the defection of the Governours of the Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary Towns in <hi>Poictou,</hi> the revolt of <hi>Pardaillan</hi> with a part of <hi>Guienne,</hi> that of <hi>Chaſtillon</hi> in the lower <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and that by the

preſence of the Duke <hi>de Leſdiguieres</hi> they were aſſured alſo of <hi>Dauphine;</hi> the King ſets forth, not to a Warre, but a certaine Victory: The Duke <hi>de Luynes,</hi> lately made Conſtable of <hi>France,</hi> goes with him, who ſo abſolutely poſſeſſed his Maſters favour, that in the progreſs of this Warre, we ſhall ſee, not the intentions of the King, but the Treaſons and diſloyalties of this Upſtart executed, who having by that means crept into a fortune, ruled all with a Soveraign power which he continued even to this death, leaving the King's Council ſuch a Copy, whoſe imitation would prove the ruine of the Kingdom:</p>
               <p>The firſt teſtimony of the lubricity, and inſincerity of their words, was given at <hi>Saumure,</hi> which, to the violation of the Faith engaged in his Patent, was taken from <hi>Du Pleſſis Mornay:</hi> The ſame ſucceſſe alſo had all the Townes in <hi>Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctou.</hi>

               <p>The Dukes of <hi>Rohan,</hi> and <hi>Soubize</hi> his brother, who had oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the convocation of the Aſſembly, and earneſtly endeavoured their diſſolution, when convened, ſeeing ſuch a rout, reſolved not to abandon the party: The Conſtable, who was their kinf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, many times ſent to try their pulſes; but neither his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, nor threats, made the leaſt impreſſion on their conſciences, or fidelity: The laſt Meſſenger was the Colonel <hi>Arnaud,</hi> who brought them Letters from the King, full of perſwaſions to quit their reſolutions, and intermixed with menaces of an inevitable ruine in caſe they obſtinately perſevered in them; and withal to let them know that the firſt ſiege would be that of <hi>Saint John d' Angely:</hi> But this journey had a double end; for, in caſe he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed not upon the two brothers, he had Orders to conferre with the Major General <hi>Auriac,</hi> who was then at <hi>Saint Julian,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a quarter of a League from <hi>Saint John,</hi> with four thouſand men, to cauſe him to put in execution a deſign he was entred on, by means of the intelligence he had with the Captaines, <hi>Galloix,</hi> and <hi>Vaux,</hi> and two of the inhabitants, whoſe names were <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,</hi> and <hi>Roquier,</hi> who had promiſed, if he would approach with his Troops, and fall in upon the Suburbs called <hi>Mata,</hi> and thence make up ſtraight to the Gate, they would be ready there, with their confederates, and keep it open; which <hi>Auriac</hi> attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted the very next day after <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s departure from <hi>Saint John:</hi> But the preſence of the Dukes of <hi>Rohan</hi> and <hi>Soubize,</hi> both which were yet in the Town, prevented their ſucceſs; <hi>Soubize</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to abide a Siege; and <hi>Rohan</hi> three dayes after went to <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelle,</hi> from whence he brought and put a thouſand men into the Town, with above an hundred Gentlemen, beſides two Barques laden with all manner of proviſions; and then went back to <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne.</hi>

               <p>He was deſired by the Aſſembly to reconcile <hi>La Force</hi> and <hi>Pardaillan,</hi> to which the former was very much inclined, but the other would not ſo much as ſee the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> by which he clearly perceived his engagement to the Court: <hi>La Force</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired <hi>Rohan</hi> to take a view of the Communalties of the lower <hi>Guienne,</hi> that he might the better take order for the ſecurity of the diviſion the Aſſembly had allotted him. From thence he goes to <hi>Bergerac, Saint Foy, Clerac,</hi> and <hi>Tonneins,</hi> and thence to <hi>Nerac,</hi> where the Chamber, or Court of Juſtice yet was, but muſt be removed, before they could ſecure the Caſtle, where the Court ſate, and where the Preſident, a <hi>Romanist,</hi> lodged; who after many conteſts, at length withdrew with one Gentleman, whom the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> gave him for his Convoy as far as <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande:</hi> But the Preſident made but an unhandſome return of this civility: For when he returned to <hi>Tonneins,</hi> he gave <hi>Vig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noles</hi> intelligence of it, who about a League from <hi>Tonneins</hi> lay in ambuſh for him, with ſix or ſeven ſcore Gentlemen Voluntiers armed at all points, and three other Troops, who let them paſs, and then the firſt Troop followed their Reare, the ſecond mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched up to flanck them, and the third, which was the ſtrongeſt, between the other two, that they might be ready to relieve the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon all occaſions: The Marqueſs <hi>de la Force,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Rohan</hi>'s light Horſemen, was left to make good the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, with thirty of <hi>La Force</hi> his guard, whom he cauſed to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light from their Horſes, and thirty other Horſe, among which there were but ten <hi>Cuiraſſes:</hi> The Marqueſs advertiſes <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han</hi> and <hi>La Force,</hi> that the enemy marched towards him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they face about, and advance, commanding him to charge them: But the firſt Troop inſtead of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eceiving the charge, flew off towards <hi>Vignoles;</hi> when preſently half of <hi>La Force</hi>'s Guards gave them a Volley, which killed and hurt about five or ſix Men and Horſes, which made them keep off at a Muſquet ſhot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from them. The ſecond Troop, which flanked them, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a little Ditch between them and <hi>Rohan,</hi> fell off, as the firſt did: Which <hi>Vignoles</hi> ſeeing, advanced not at all with the third, ſo that without any further interruption, they kept on their way to <hi>Tonneins:</hi> Among the Troops of <hi>Rohan,</hi> and <hi>La Force,</hi> were there but fourteene <hi>Cuiraſſes;</hi> and of Gentlemen, and their ſervants, not above ſeventy ſix Horſe.</p>
               <p>After this, <hi>Rohan</hi> left <hi>La Force</hi> who very exactly knew the Countrey of the lower <hi>Guienne,</hi> and went from <hi>Nerac</hi> to <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauban,</hi> fetching a compaſs of above five and thirty Leagues, by reaſon that the Marſhal <hi>Themines</hi> lay in his way, and arrived there on the eighteenth of <hi>July,</hi> One thouſand ſix hundred and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:170346:34"/>
twenty one: At <hi>Montauban</hi> he received intelligence that <hi>Nerac</hi> was beſieged by the Duke of <hi>Maine,</hi> who commanded in to him the Marſhal, and all the Nobility of <hi>Guyenne: La Force</hi> at the ſame time makes an attempt upon <hi>Caumont,</hi> ſurprizes the Town, and layes a fiege to the Caſtle; The Duke of <hi>Maine</hi> having a ſtrong Army, reſolves to releive it, and to continue the Siege of <hi>Nerac</hi> alſo, in which he had a fortunate ſucceſs; and the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> to divert <hi>Themines,</hi> lies down before <hi>Septfons,</hi> a place belonging to himſelf; and when he had drawn him thither, with above five hundred Voluntiers, he retired to <hi>Realville,</hi> and the Marſhal to <hi>Puy-la Roque:</hi> whence, after three or four dayes abode there, he drew away againe, and the Duke went to <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauban,</hi> to preſerve the adjacent Countrey from the ravage and ſpoile intended by the Marſhal, who followed him thither, where there paſſed between them ſome light skirmiſhes, of no great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.</p>
               <p>Whiles the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> remained at <hi>Montauban,</hi> came news to him, of the rendition of <hi>Saint John,</hi> and alſo of <hi>Pons,</hi> which was ſold by <hi>Chasteau-neuf,</hi> of the revolt of <hi>Pardaillan,</hi> the loſs of <hi>Saint Foy,</hi> and alſo of <hi>Bergerac,</hi> by the treachery of <hi>Pardaillan,</hi> and <hi>Paniſſault;</hi> of the taking of <hi>Nerac</hi> by the Duke of <hi>Maine</hi> (who was drawing towards <hi>Gaſcony</hi>) which was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed alſo with the loſs of <hi>Lectour, Leyrac, Mas de Verdun, Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiſin,</hi> and the <hi>Iſle-Jourdan;</hi> all which places the Governours for money yielded up into the hands of the Duke of <hi>Maine.</hi> Nor did they behave themſelves better in the lower <hi>Guienne:</hi> For <hi>Tournon, Mont-Flanquin, Puymirol,</hi> and divers other places were delivered by their Governours; and, which is moſt prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, <hi>Favas,</hi> that was then with the Aſſembly general, at <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelle,</hi> commanded his ſonne to give up to the King <hi>Caſtel-Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loux,</hi> and <hi>Castetz,</hi> two cautionary places, and remote from the King's way about twelve or fifteen Leagues. In ſhort, of all that great Province, no place made any ſemblance of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition but <hi>Clerac,</hi> which was well fortified and manned, there being in it (compriſing the Inhabitants) three thouſand figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting men.</p>
               <p>Theſe great loſſes made the Duke conceive, that ſeeing there had not been any reſiſtance made in <hi>La Force</hi>'s diviſion, he ſhould ſuddenly have the Royal Army upon him: Wherefore he takes care to provide for <hi>Montauban,</hi> marks ſome of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>places neceſſary to be fortified, makes up the Regiment of the Count <hi>d' Orval</hi> ten Companies, reduces the Inhabitants into thirty, and orders all things fitting for a long Siege, and reſolves himſelf to go to <hi>Castres,</hi> thence into the lower <hi>Languedoc,</hi> to

               <p>In the mean while, the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> that he might loſe no time, ſends to the <hi>Sevenes,</hi> and the lower <hi>Languedoc,</hi> for a ſupply of four thouſand men, and he himſelf goes as far as <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laud,</hi> where he underſtood by the Meſſengers he had ſent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that though the people were generally well inclined, yet would the Artifices of the diſaffected prevail over their good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, unleſs he himſelf advanced to the <hi>Sevenes.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Chaſtillon,</hi> at the ſame time, ſent <hi>Briquemaut</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> to invite him to a conference, which he accepted of, and to that end advanced as far as far as <hi>Saint Hippolyte,</hi> where the ſaid <hi>Briquemaut</hi> returns againe to the Duke from <hi>Chaſtillon,</hi> to let him know, that he very much wondred that he ſhould enter into the diviſon allotted him, and that he ſuſpected it was with a deſign to prejudice his authority: It was anſwered him, That certainly he had no good memory, and withal was ſhewn him the Letter he had written to the Duke, that the only expedient to drive him out of the <hi>Sevenes,</hi> and ſtop his paſſages into the lower <hi>Languedoc,</hi> was, not to impede the ſuccours he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, which rather than faile of, he would encounter all difficulties whatſoever: that if he was deſirous of an interview, he was very ready to ſatisfie him; and that if he would in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon go to the relief of <hi>Montauban,</hi> as he had offered, he was confident, they two would be able to procure the peace of the whole Kingdom.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, after he had ſtrugled with many difficulties, he drew at length four thouſand.

of his Souldiers to be made ready.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the King having beſieged, and by reaſon of their inteſtine diviſions for want of a Commander in Chief, taken <hi>Clerac,</hi> and ſeized upon all the places about <hi>Montaubon,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>Saint Antonin,</hi> ſate down with his Army before <hi>Montan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> on the one and twentieth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> One thouſand ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty one, (where <hi>La Force,</hi> with his two ſons, were gotten in) and ſent the Duke of <hi>Angouleſme,</hi> with fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horſe, and foure thouſand Foot, to lie upon the River <hi>Tarn,</hi> and intercept the relief was preparing for <hi>Montauban;</hi> who made as if he would beſiege <hi>Lombez,</hi> a place, about half a League from <hi>Realmont,</hi> where there was a Caſtle that comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Town, and held alwayes for the King. The Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> receiving intelligence of it from <hi>Malauze,</hi> and alſo of the conſpiracy in agitation for the delivery of <hi>Caſtres,</hi> with all ſpeed ſends away <hi>Boye,</hi> one of his Colonels, with a thouſand foot, and a faithful promiſe to follow him ſuddenly with the reſt of the Army.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Boyer</hi> came to <hi>Castres,</hi> he found that <hi>Malauze</hi> had drawn his main Body to <hi>Realmont;</hi> whither his coming alſo, with this ſupply, raiſed the Duke of <hi>Angouleſme</hi> from before <hi>Lombez;</hi> whereupon <hi>Malauze,</hi> inſtead of expecting the arrival of the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> as he had commanded him, but ſuffering himſelf to be carried away with the importunity of the multitude, goes with one piece of Canon, which he drew out of <hi>Realmont,</hi> to beſiege a Church that was Gariſon'd and Fortifi'd, called <hi>La-Fauch,</hi> which as <hi>Boyer</hi> was viewing he was ſlaine, and the Duke of <hi>Angouleſme</hi> at the inſtant the Church was ſurrendred, came and incloſed the reſt of the party with his whole Army: After ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral charges and skirmiſhes, in which <hi>Balauze</hi> behaved himſelf with much Gallantry, and <hi>Saint Rome</hi> alſo, in reſucing him, (for he charged through the mid'ſt of the enemy, with fifty Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen (many of whom he loſt) they capitulated to march off with their Armes, all but their Canon; and, for the ſpace of ſix months not to beare Armes for the party: Thus were all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with their Chiefs, and all the Nobility of <hi>Albigeois,</hi> and <hi>Laura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guais,</hi> diſabled from any ſervice for the remaining part of that, and untill <hi>March</hi> the year following.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> for his part, loſes no time, but advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with his Troops, and while his Rear-guard was marching up to him, draws the Canon out of <hi>Millaud,</hi> takes <hi>Saint George</hi> a ſmall, but well incloſed place, and <hi>Luzanſon</hi> a private houſe lying between <hi>Millaud</hi> and <hi>Saint Afrique,</hi> in which there was a Gariſon that extreamly incommoded his paſſage; and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170346:36"/>
had continued till he had cleared the whole way, had not the intelligence he received of the defeat at <hi>Fauch</hi> diverted him; that made him double his pace, ſo that he came very oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely to <hi>Castres;</hi> for <hi>Lombez</hi> was ſurrendred, <hi>Realmont</hi> was in Treaty, and the whole Countrey in a drooping condition: He cheered them up the beſt he could; yet all he could do, was not ſufficient to get thirty Gentlemen, nor two hundred Foot toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in all the upper <hi>Languedoc;</hi> So that his whole dependance was only on thoſe he brought with him from the Lower <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and the <hi>Sevenes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another fear alſo perplexed him, leſt in his abſence, <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stillon</hi> ſhould recall his Troops, to prevent which, he oppoſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him an Aſſembly of five Provinces, <hi>viz.</hi> The Lower <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc,</hi> the <hi>Sevenes, Vivaretz,</hi> the Upper <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and <hi>Dauphine,</hi> who impowered him to detaine the ſupplyes he already had, and to raiſe more in caſe he had occaſion for them.</p>
               <p>Things being in this condition, the Duke ſends to diſcover what Fordes were paſſable and not guarded, furniſhes himſelf with good guides, and formes his deſign to relieve <hi>Montauban,</hi> at the ſame time, by the way of <hi>Ville-nouvelle,</hi> by <hi>Saint Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nin,</hi> and of <hi>Ville-Bourbon</hi> by <hi>Carming.</hi> The firſt of which is five Leagues diſtant from <hi>Montauban,</hi> the other ten; ſo that he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to put in his greateſt relief, conſiſting all of Foot, on that ſide; and the leſſer, compoſed of <hi>Dragoons,</hi> and threeſcore <hi>Reformado's</hi> only, on the other.</p>
               <p>In the interim of theſe actions, the Conſtable <hi>Luynes</hi> ſeeing that his Embaſſies ſent to the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> by <hi>Saint Angel</hi> and <hi>Saludie,</hi> could not move him, nor the perſwaſions of the Duke of <hi>Sully,</hi> and <hi>Leſdiguieres</hi> thoſe of <hi>Montauban,</hi> who ſtill replyed, That they would do nothing without the advice and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of their General, reſolved at length to give them leave to ſend their Deputies to him (who were conducted by <hi>Deſplans</hi>) to try if that might produce an accommodation, who came juſt as the relief was ready to march: And very opportunely too; for the Duke underſtanding by them, that they wanted nothing but men, and that if they had but a thouſand, or twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred more, they were confident they ſhould be able to hold out all that Winter, he promiſed them that, with in eight dayes they ſhould have the recruit they deſired, gave them the Word, and Signal, and ſo they returned.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> had five hundred <hi>Dragoons,</hi> whom with hopes of pillaging the Countrey up to the very Gates of <hi>Thoulouſe,</hi> he had encouraged to advance towards <hi>Puylaurens, Cuc,</hi> and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170346:36"/>
                  <hi>Carmaing;</hi> but when they were all met at their appointed Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous, he ſent them orders, by one of his Gentlemen to march directly to <hi>Montauban,</hi> which orders were not obſerved, either by reaſon of too much conſideration, or apprehenſion of the danger, though there were leſs on that, than on the other ſide.</p>
               <p>As for the other relief, commanded by <hi>Beauſort,</hi> one of his Colonels, it was better ordered: He marched from <hi>Caſtres</hi> in the evening, with about a thouſand or twelve hundred men, comes to <hi>Lombez</hi> about one of the clock in the morning, where he ſtays till the next night, then fordes the <hi>Tarn</hi> at <hi>Grave,</hi> marches all night, and the next evening about five of the clock comes to <hi>Saint Antonin,</hi> without any ill <hi>rencontre</hi> at all: There he ſtays all the next day, and in the evening ſets forward towards <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauban.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the falſeneſs of the guides he had taken up at <hi>Saint Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nin,</hi> who betrayed him, forced him to return thither againe: Three dayes after they ſent him a guide from <hi>Montauban,</hi> who ſafely conducted him over the River <hi>Veyrou</hi> at a Forde, and brought him very well within half a League of the Town; whence, notwithſtanding the ſeveral parties both of Horſe and Foot he perpetually met with between that and the Town, and the many Redoubts and trenches that obſtructed his paſſage, he vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all thoſe difficulties, and put ſeven hundred men, and nine Colours into <hi>Montauban:</hi> But <hi>Beaufort</hi> himſelf came ſhort of it, being taken in this brave action: And it is to be obſerved, that this relief which conſiſted all of Foot, marched every day almoſt eighteen Leagues in an enemies Countrey, forded through two dangerous Rivers, and paſſed through the mid'ſt of two Royal Armies that lay in wait to defeat them.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> took a double courſe to proſper the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of this relief; one was by ſending <hi>Calonges,</hi> and <hi>Des-Iſles</hi> with <hi>Desplans</hi> to conſult with thoſe before <hi>Montauban,</hi> about ſome way of accommodation; the other was, by marching at the ſame time that <hi>Beaufort</hi> did, with forty Colours of Foot, and thoſe few Horſe he had, towards <hi>Lauraguais:</hi> So that when the Duke of <hi>Angouleſme</hi> was ready to purſue <hi>Beaufort</hi> with all his Cavalry, he received intelligence that the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> with the greateſt part of his forces, was upon his march for <hi>Laura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guais,</hi> which put ſuch a Dilemma on him, that he knew not which way to turn; and in the mean time <hi>Beaufort</hi> paſſes through the mid'ſt of his Army, and the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, return'd to <hi>Castres,</hi> and ſent back his Troops to the places whence he had drawn them.</p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:170346:37"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Calonges</hi> and <hi>Des-Iſles</hi> were in the King's Quarters, when theſe ſupplies got in, and thence returned to <hi>Caſtres</hi> with <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plans,</hi> who from the Conſtable carried the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation to an interview, which he accepted of; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the diſſwaſions of the people of <hi>Caſtres,</hi> and almoſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that was about him, he went to <hi>Villemur,</hi> and had a conference with him at <hi>Reviers,</hi> about a League from <hi>Montau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban,</hi> where after an exchange of many complements, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable led him aſide into an Alley, and there began with him in this manner; I am much obliged to you that you have repoſed ſuch confidence in me; it ſhall not at all deceive you; you are no leſs ſecure here than in <hi>Caſtres:</hi> Being entred into your al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyance, I cannot but be ſtudious of your proſperity; deprive me not of the opportunity, during the favour I enjoy, to augment the ſplendour of your houſe. You have relieved <hi>Montauban</hi> even before your Soveraign's face, a glorious and heroick action; but abuſe it not: It is high time for you to mind your own and your friends advantage; the King will never conſent to a general peace; ſee therefore that you make conditions for your friends and ſervants, and let thoſe of <hi>Montauban</hi> know that they have but a ſhort reprieve from their ruine; that the Forts and Lines drawn about them, have barred up alwayes to their further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief that, unleſs they now accept of reaſonable termes, to wit, either a Cittadel, Gariſon, or Demolition of all their fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, you will utterly deſert them: As for <hi>Caſtres,</hi> and the reſt of the places in your diviſion, propoſe what you pleaſe, and it ſhall be granted; and for your own particular, a blanck is offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you, inſert your own conditions. In vaine may you hope for any aſſiſtance from <hi>Germany;</hi> they have more need to crave, than lend aide; or from <hi>England;</hi> you know the peaceable humour of that King; or from within our own Kingdome; the Queene Mother has all her ſupport from <hi>Spaine, Rome, Savoy,</hi> and the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> who are no friends to the <hi>Huguenots;</hi> and as for <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur</hi> the Prince, a piece of money ſwayes him any way; As for <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Count of <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> I have received Letters from him and from his Mother, who is ready to ſend him in to the King: As for the other Grandees of <hi>France,</hi> I doubt not but you receive encouragement from them; but 'tis with intention to purchaſe their own ends at your expence. I have, with much difficulty, hitherto hindred the confiſcation of your eſtate and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I cannot longer oppoſe it; you muſt either reſolve to fall under a certain and ignominious ruine, or to advance your houſe to a greater height than it ever yet knew: For if you perſiſt in your obſtinacy, the King will rather yield to all thoſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion

               <p>To which the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> anſwered, I ſhould be an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to my ſelf, if I deſired not my Prince his favour, and your friendſhip; I ſhall never refuſe either goods or honours from my Maſter; nor from you the Offices of a good Kinſman: I very well conſider the danger I am in, but I beſeech you alſo reflect upon yours; you are mortally and univerſally hated, for that you alone ingroſs that which is the object of every ones deſire: The ruine of thoſe of the Religion is not ſo near, but that they may afford leaſure enough to the Male-contents to forme their parties, and thoſe that will not openly declare for us, will yet comply in any thing that may tend to your deſtruction. The beginnings of the Warres againſt thoſe of the Religion, have commonly been with great diſadvantages to them, which yet the reſtleſs and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile humour of the <hi>French,</hi> the diſcontents of thoſe that ruled not, and ſtrangers have many times repaired: If you can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a peace for us from the King, before the like miſchiefs hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen againe, it will be much for his honour and advantage; For having ſubdued the party without the leaſt check, without any appearance either of diviſions within, or relief from without, he will oblige his conquered, and manifeſt to the world, that 'tis not the Religion he perſecutes, but the Profeſſours of it; for their pretended diſobedience, will break the neck of all other factions, and, without any prejudice received, will return a feared and honoured Conquerour: This will alſo redouble your credit with him, and ſeat you in a condition above the reach of any attempt whatſoever: But if you drive things on to the extremity, and this torrent of proſperity continue not its courſe, as it is like to finde a bay at <hi>Montauban,</hi> every one will re-erect his ſpirits, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the buſineſs of <hi>Pont de Ce,</hi> and our later loſſes here, and infinite perplexities will you be involved in: Conſider that you have already gathered all the fruits, that either your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, or threats can produce, and that what is left of us fight for a Religion we believe to be the true one. As for my part I have already conſidered of the loſs of my eſtate, and Offices, which if you have retarded out of reſpect to our alliance, I am obliged to you for it, but am fully reſolved, and prepared for all extremities, being ſolemnly engaged by promiſe, my conſcience alſo commanding me, not to hearken to any but a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Peace.</p>

               <p>This Conference, becauſe they would not admit of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Treaty, proving ineffectual, the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> returned to <hi>Caſtres.</hi> The difficulties at the Siege of <hi>Montauban</hi> dayly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, the Conſtable liſtened to the better dictates of his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thoughts, and renewed the Treaty: But the unſteadineſs of his ſpirit, too fickle to perfect any thing, and the contradictions he met with from thoſe that deſired a continuation of the War, intangled him ſtill in delayes, till the King was neceſſitated to raiſe the Siege of <hi>Montauban,</hi> on the eighteenth of <hi>November,</hi> One thouſand ſix hundred twenty one, where <hi>La Force,</hi> and the firſt <hi>Conſul Dupuy,</hi> a man of great authority and courage order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all things ſo exactly for the defence of the Town, and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the publick reſolutions, that they may worthily claime a great part in the honour of preſerving the place.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> in the mean while, had ſent his troops into the County of <hi>Foix</hi> upon the ſollicitation of <hi>Leran,</hi> who with them took in ſome Caſtles and afterwards laid Siege to <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reilles,</hi> which was relieved, and he, in ſome diſorder, retreated to <hi>Pamiers:</hi> But ſeeing the King's Army now at liberty, having quitted the Siege of <hi>Montauban,</hi> he took care to provide for thoſe places were moſt in danger; and remanded his Forces from <hi>Foix: Saint Florent,</hi> one of his Colonels, and a Kinſman of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables, to make his own conditions, had intended to ſeize upon <hi>Saint Espuel;</hi> and in purſuance of that deſign, and that he might with leſs difficulty be received into the Town, with his Regiment, counterfeited a Letter from the Duke of <hi>Rohan;</hi> But the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls,</hi> forewarn'd of his purpoſes, refus'd to let him in; ſo that the ſtay he made thereabouts, gave the enemy an opportunity to preapare an Ambaſcade for him between <hi>le Mas</hi> and <hi>Revel,</hi> where in the night time he was totaliy defeated, without any reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance made of his ſide.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Chaſtillon</hi> propoſes to the Aſſembly of the five Provinces, the recalling of their Forces, upon pretence to relieve the lower <hi>Languedoc,</hi> which yet was no way invaded, but they rejected the propoſition; ſo that, this invention taking no effect, as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> of new ſupplies; he cauſes a new levy to be made (at which he was not preſent himſelf) which the Aſſembly gave way to, upon the engagement of the Captains to wait upon him, in caſe the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> ſhould command them, which yet they refuſed to do upon his ſummons, ſaying, That they owned no General but <hi>Chaſtillon,</hi> but trifled away their time in beſieging <hi>Alzon,</hi> a paltry Town of no importance.

               <p>The Aſſembly on the other ſide, maintained, That they ought no account to any but to the Aſſembly general, from whom they derived their authority; that they ought to continue in full power, till a final determination of all affairs; that the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ought to have no other Council but themſelves; and that to them belonged the ſole management of the <hi>Finances;</hi> that they were Superiour to the particular Provinces, who had nothing to do to ſuperviſe their actions, nor had they power of themſelves to ſummon any Conventions; and perſwaded the Duke to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict them, as themſelves, before his arrival, had intended to have done: But he, ſeeing the Province of the <hi>Sevenes</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready convened, and that the lower <hi>Languedoc</hi> was reſolved upon the like courſe, endeavoured to get the Aſſemblies allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it, who inſtead of aſſenting to it, becauſe they foreſaw it would much impaire the continuation of their Seſſion, reſolved on other wayes to prolong it. And firſt of all they uſed all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble means to poſſeſs themſelves of the Caſtle of <hi>Sommiers,</hi> back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Berticheres,</hi> who pretended a right to it, and addreſſed themſelves to <hi>Chaſtillon</hi> for his aſſiſtance: But defeated of their purpoſes by the diligence of the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> and the Caſtle ſecured, they turn their applications to the Duke <hi>de Leſdigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eres,</hi> to whom they deſcribed the Duke to be an ambitious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, deſirous to perpetuate the War, that he might continue his power; and declaring alſo, that they had rather ſubmit to a peace with the King upon any terms, than to his Tyranny; and that if he intermedled further with them, he ſhould be taught to know the limits of his power; But he refuſing to hearken to them, and all their other attempts failing of the ſucceſs they aimed at, they ſend Deputies to the <hi>Sevenes,</hi> and the lower <hi>Languedoc,</hi> where the Duke was, who to prevent a further rupture (which proved a matter of great difficulty, ſo much were the Provinces of <hi>Languedoc</hi> incenſed againſt the Aſſembly) got them to allow of the actions of the Aſſembly of the five Provinces, to receive their Deputies into their protection; that there ſhould be no peace concluded without proviſion for their ſecurity, but that they ſhould forbear to Act as an Aſſembly, till the buſineſs were
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:170346:39"/>
further determin'd by the Aſſembly general, to whom all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were to ſend their reaſons; and that two Deputies of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of the five Provinces, ſhould be of the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi>'s Council.</p>
               <p>It is to be obſerved, that after the Duke's arrival at <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellier,</hi> the Aſſembly that ſate there, before his face, diſpoſed abſolutely of the <hi>Finances,</hi> and of all other affaires, made Laws, gave paſs ports, and protections; and in all that time referred no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to his Council of War but one quarrel to be pieced up there; And when the Duke propoſed to them a Convention of the States of all <hi>Languedoc</hi> to be held at <hi>Millaud,</hi> to conſult about the raiſing of money, and to provide for the adminiſtration of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, they ſtiffely withſtood it, becauſe they feared it was to abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate their authority.</p>
               <p>When they had occaſion to ſend to the Aſſembly general, the Duke moved that they would ſend joyntly with him and the other Provinces; but they were ſtill for ſeveral Deputations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſolved to calumniate him, what they could; which they did ſufficiently by their Envoy <hi>Babat</hi> a Miniſter, who recounted the wonders they did, before the Duke came among them, who had ſince confounded all by his ambition; that, he purſued his own, at the expence of the publick Intereſt; that having ruined <hi>Foix,</hi> and <hi>Albigeois,</hi> he would do as much to the lower <hi>Languedoc,</hi> where he began to fix himſelf, and play <hi>Rex;</hi> that they were better fall into the hands of the King, and entirely ſubmit to his will, than to be ſubject to this Duke; and that at length they ſhould be faine to recall <hi>Chaſtillon:</hi> That they ſhould beware of coming under the power of <hi>Soubize,</hi> who deſired nothing more than the diſſipation of the Aſſembly general, and had already written to the Duke, that it was compoſed only of ſeven or eight pitiful Raſcals; and for concluſion, that if they would but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power them to continue their Seſſion, they would curb the Duke well enough.</p>
               <p>After the Convention of theſe Provincial Aſſemblies, the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> conſidering, on one ſide, the preparations made by the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> to invade him, the Levyes of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> in <hi>Provence,</hi> for the ſame purpoſe, <hi>Chastillon's</hi> plots to undermine him, and the Levyes of the Duke <hi>de Leſdigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eres</hi> to invade <hi>Vivaretz;</hi> And on the other, the miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition he found the Provinces, he came to ſerve in, by reaſon of the many needleſs armings <hi>Chaſtillon</hi> had made there, to the great diſcouragement of the Souldiery, and ruine of their friends Countrey, whence the Troops never ſtirred, exhauſting of their treaſures, and ſtores of Salt, aggravated by the impoſſbili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

               <p>
                  <hi>Blaccons</hi> Lieutenaut of <hi>Vivaretz</hi> being in the mean while hard beſet by the Duke of <hi>Leſdiguicrs,</hi> ſollicites the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> for a ſupply of five hundred men, and withal, that he would make haſte to follow them with his whole forces: Thoſe of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darieux</hi> and <hi>Gignac,</hi> likewiſe demand ſome relief, for that the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> had ſuprized <hi>Lunas,</hi> and forced <hi>Greſſiſſac,</hi> both private houſes, beſieged <hi>Fougeres,</hi> and threatned alſo the above named places: The Duke, having no Forces on Foot, and two Armies upon his hands, excluding the Troops of <hi>Provence,</hi> goes to the <hi>Sevenes</hi> to try if he could thence paſs five hundred men into <hi>Vivaretz;</hi> but at the ſtraights near <hi>Villeneufve de Berg,</hi> were they repulſed, which obliged him to ſend to the Duke of <hi>Leſdiguieres,</hi> to ſee if he could by any means retard his advance: But, notwithſtanding his Remonſtrances, and the dead of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter beſides, he continues his march with ſix thouſand Foot, and five hundred Horſe; to make a Bridge over the <hi>Rhone,</hi> between <hi>Bay</hi> and <hi>Pouſin,</hi> beſieges <hi>Pouſin,</hi> and batters it, which abides his aſſault, <hi>Blaccens</hi> gets in to it, and behaves himſelf bravely in the ſtorme; at length, the place being ready to be loſt, by the mediation of him, whom the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> had ſent to the Duke <hi>de Leſdiguieres,</hi> was yielded to him, upon condition, that if the peace (they were now in Treaty on) were not concluded, he ſhould again reſtore it to thoſe of the Religion; that he ſhould forthwith withdraw his Army, and ſhould not make any further at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts in <hi>Vivaretz,</hi> nor <hi>Languedoc:</hi> And he for his part promiſed, as ſoon as poſſible, to ſend the Preſident <hi>Du Cros</hi> to proceed in the Treaty for a Peace.</p>
               <p>The Province of <hi>Vivarets</hi> Aſſembled at <hi>Privas,</hi> approved of all, and wrote to the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> in favour of <hi>Blaccons,</hi> that he would confer on him the Government of <hi>Bay,</hi> which he granted.</p>

               <p>Having recovered his health, about the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> and ſpeeded his Levies, he took the field, before he was well able to endure it, <hi>Berticheres</hi> made a motion to attach the Tower <hi>Charbonniere,</hi> that opening that paſſage they might have Salt by that way, and conſequently money to defray part of the charges of the War; <hi>Saint Blancart,</hi> Governour of <hi>Peccaix,</hi> ſeconded the Propoſition, ſo that, that deſigne was concluded on; <hi>Chaſtillon</hi> preſently had notice of it, and the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> was informed that <hi>Berticheres</hi> had faithfully promiſed him that he would ruine all his troops: Wherefore the Duke reſolved to refer this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to a farther debate; at which he urged againſt <hi>Berticheres</hi> the difficulty of the ſiege; <hi>Saint Blancart</hi> thereupon ſtood up, and ſaid, That unleſſe they reſolved on it, he would comply with <hi>Chaſtillon,</hi> there being otherwiſe no poſſibility of their ſubſiſtence; ſo that he was conſtrained to yeild to it; and in the meane while he makes an attempt on <hi>Beaucaire,</hi> which ſucceeding not, by reaſon of the extream coldneſſe, and tempeſtuouſneſſe of the night, it was executed in, he returned to the Tower <hi>Charbonniere,</hi> where he found that inſtead of advancing, they were driven off, and that they had ſuffered <hi>Chastillon</hi> to fortifie ſeveral intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he had made upon a Cauſey, which at firſt might have eaſily been forced, but would now require more than a moneths time to take them.

               <p>The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> returned to his Army, which he found at <hi>Caſtelnau</hi> near <hi>Montpellier;</hi> The Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> with <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillon,</hi> who was now joyned with him with his <hi>Gens d' armes,</hi> or no ſe men compleatly armed, and thoſe of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> which he had ſent for out of <hi>Provence,</hi> had beſieged <hi>Courvouſée,</hi> two leagues diſtant from <hi>Montpellier,</hi> which the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> had reſolved to relieve, but the place being yeilded the next day, he encamped at <hi>Saint John de Vedas,</hi> and <hi>Salle-neuſve,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> at <hi>La Veruve, Fabregues,</hi> and <hi>Sauſſan;</hi> a ſmall river called <hi>Mouſſon,</hi> parted them, ſo that for ſix dayes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, both armies played only with their Canon one upon another, after which the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> retires to <hi>Ville-neufve</hi> a ſmall Town upon the Lake.

               <p>
                  <hi>Berticheres,</hi> whether it was that he feared the loſſe of his goods, or that he deſired to ruine the Dukes Army, or that really he had received ſuch intelligence, comes and tells the Duke, that for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> had paſſed the Lake, and was marching towards Saint <hi>Gilles,</hi> an Abbey belonging to <hi>Berticheres,</hi> and a very convenient place for a Magazine; beſeeching him to allow him fifteen hundred foot, and an hundred horſe to prevent him, and that according to the intelligence he ſhould receive from him, the reſt of the forces might be in a readineſſe to follow him; which the Duke granted him; and in the meane while, with two thouſand men he had left, goes to beſiege <hi>Saint Georges:</hi> But the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> hearing that <hi>Sain Georges</hi> was beſieged, and that the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi>'s army was divided, returns to relieve it, takes up his quarters at <hi>Saint John de Vedas,</hi> a league from <hi>Saint Georges,</hi> and by diſcharging of two piece of Canon, gives them a ſignal of the ſuccours he had brought, and that very night eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayed to put in two hundred men, who were briskly repulſed.

now three thouſand foot, and three hundred horſe ſtrong, in the very ſight of the Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> raiſes his batteries, and takes the place, which was yeilded upon compoſition, the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants lives only ſaved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Berticheres</hi> was the ſecond time like to have been the occaſion of another great fault, by his obſtinate affirming that the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> was retreated to <hi>Ville-neuſve,</hi> and had left five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men at the Bridge of <hi>Veruve,</hi> which might be eaſily cut off: The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> was of a contrary opinion, averring, that if he himſelf were gone off, he would not have left thoſe foot to the ſlaughter; the other deſirous to evidence what he had affirmed, leads him towards the Bridge, where they found ſome forlorne par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Muſquetires in the ditches, which they ſoone made them quit: But <hi>Rohan</hi> perceiving that <hi>Berticheres</hi> had engaged a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment too far, commands all his forces, both horſe and foot, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, and two field-pieces to be drawn after them; <hi>Berticheren</hi> cloſely purſues his deſigne, commands <hi>Blacquiere</hi>'s Regiment to ſtorme the trenches at the Bridge, and another Squadron to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond them: But this being but an extempore project, and executed without any precedent deliberation, was alſo without ſucceſſe: For <hi>Blacquiere,</hi> and his Serjeant Major <hi>Randon</hi> being ſlaine with Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet ſhot, the whole party retreated in diſorder; and at the ſame inſtant the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> drew all his Army into <hi>Battatia,</hi> firing two field-pieces on our men; <hi>Rohan</hi> made him the like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from his ſide, and all the remaining part of that day was ſpent in <hi>Canonades,</hi> and light skirmiſhes; the river <hi>Mouſſon</hi> ſtill ſeparating the Armies, who in the evening drew off to their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: There were ten or twelve ſlain on either ſide; and the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> the ſecond time retired to <hi>Ville-neufve;</hi> whence, leaving his Troops in Garriſon in the adjacent places he went to <hi>Pezenas;</hi> which the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> having notice of, takes with him proviſion for two dayes, and with two Culverins marches that night to <hi>Gignac,</hi> blocks up the garriſon'd Church adjoyning to it, raiſes his battery in the open day, and after the firſt Volley took it upon capitulation, and having demoliſhed it, returns to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Montpellier;</hi> taking his way through the Valley of <hi>Montfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,</hi> where he took and diſmantled <hi>Mattelais,</hi> and other little pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and fortified Churches, which yeilded his ſouldiers good boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which was the reaſon that ſome of the Troops of the <hi>Sevenes,</hi> finding themſelves ſo near home, forſook him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montpellier</hi> thus freed from the inconvenience of the enemies Garriſons, made <hi>Uſez</hi> deſirous of the like benefit.

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170346:42"/>
and <hi>Saint Suffret</hi> by aſſault: But as he thought to have made a farther progreſſe, he was prevented by a requeſt from the principal inhabitants of <hi>Niſmes,</hi> to come to their Town, to ſuppreſſe a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition lately raiſed there; which with all diligence he did, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:170346:42"/>
forced to be gone, and <hi>Briſon</hi> to wait upon the Duke to excuſe this procedure.</p>
               <p>Whil'ſt he was upon his journey, the principal inhabitants of <hi>Niſmes,</hi> making good uſe of his abſence, took occaſion to procure a Declaration of the general Council of the Town, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Briſon</hi> was no longer ſupportable, that <hi>Rohan</hi> ſhould be requeſted to approve of this reſult of their deliberations, and that they might be permitted to live under the ſole authority of their own Conſuls, till a more urgent neceſſity ſhould require a Governour, and that then they would accept of any one he ſhould pleaſe to place over them; and that he would with all ſpeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to their town to prevent any diſorders might ſurvene: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he went thither, and there approved of and ratified this act of their Council. At the ſame time was there held an Aſſembly at <hi>Niſmes</hi> to take order for the ſecuring of their harveſt; to whom <hi>Briſon</hi> addreſſed his complaints; But the Aſſembly waved them, and approved of the determination of the Council, and the Dukes confirmation of it: <hi>Briſon</hi> ſeeing he could not this way arrive at his aimes, goes to <hi>Montpellier,</hi> and in all places endeavours to ſtir up the people againſt the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> attempting alſo by means of his Confederates to raiſe to ſedition in <hi>Niſmes;</hi> which the Duke having notice of, ſends the Lieutenant of his Guards with a command to arreſt him, where ever he ſhould find him, who, after ſome time ſpent in the ſearch of him, at length arreſts him in <hi>Uſez.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Niſmes</hi> was thus ſecured, order was taken for the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yying, and paying of a ſufficient number of Souldiers to preſerve the Countreys about <hi>Montpellier, Niſmes,</hi> and <hi>Uſez</hi> from the ſpoyle, and ravage, the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> had orders from the King to make in thoſe parts, and alſo to ſend ſome ſupplies to <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauban.</hi>

               <p>After the holding of this Aſſembly, it was thought fit that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſhould be convened in the <hi>Sevenes</hi> for the ſame cauſe; and foraſmuch as the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> already began to burne, and waſte the places near <hi>Montpellier, Rohan</hi> to prevent farther miſchief, left <hi>Laudez</hi> his Quartermaſter-General with a Brigade of horſe: upon the firſt approaches of <hi>Montreal</hi> Major-General to the Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> at a conteſt about a Farme-houſe, the Adjutant ſeeing his ſon too far engaged, goes with ſome Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetires to diſengage him, whereupon <hi>Montreal</hi> charges him with above an hundered horſe; but <hi>Laudez</hi> came very opportunely to his reſcue, charged, and wounded <hi>Montreal</hi> with his own hand, made him flie, and purſued him fighting up to his own body, which was in ſo tottering a condition, that had <hi>Saint Andre</hi> the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:170346:43"/>
King's Lieutenant of <hi>Montpeller</hi> made uſe of that opportunity to charge them, he had utterly routed the whole party.</p>
               <p>We muſt now return to the otherſide of the <hi>Loire,</hi> and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> had ſent to the Court: Thoſe that were deſirous of Peace, endeavoured to keep the King at <hi>Paris</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect thoſe Deputies, of whoſe ſpeedy arrival the Duke <hi>de Leſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guires</hi> had given notice; for that the Chancellour, and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident <hi>Janin,</hi> who were unfit for travel, could not otherwiſe be preſent at the Council, nor conſequently be able to withſtand the violent motions of thoſe who were inclined to a prolongation of the warre, which they perceiving, omitted no inventions to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw the King from <hi>Paris,</hi> and on <hi>Palm-Sunday</hi> carried him by ſtealth, out at a back gate of the <hi>Louvre,</hi> juſt as if they were run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away with him, to keep his <hi>Eaſter</hi> at <hi>Orleans;</hi> whence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtaying for the Queen-Mother, he goes down the River as far as <hi>Nantes;</hi> the fortunate ſucceſſe of the Duke of <hi>Soubize</hi> obliged him to take this courſe; who with two thouſand men, in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of all the Duke <hi>d' Eſpernon</hi>'s forces, in <hi>Xaintonge,</hi> and <hi>Angoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mois,</hi> of the Count <hi>de Rochefoucaults</hi> in <hi>Pictou,</hi> and <hi>Saint Lukes</hi> in the Iſlands had ſeized and fortified the Iſle of <hi>Oleron,</hi> taken <hi>Royan,</hi> the Tower of <hi>Mournac, Saugeon,</hi> and ſeveral other places, totally defeated <hi>Saint Luke</hi>'s Regiment, and at noone-day forced <hi>La Chaume,</hi> and took <hi>Les Sables:</hi> In ſhort, he ſtruck ſo great a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror into the Countrey, that had not the King's arrival prevented him, he had abſolutely made himſelf Maſter of the field: But before the arrival of the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi>'s Deputies, the condition of affairs in <hi>Pictou</hi> being much altered by the defeat of <hi>Riez,</hi> the retaking of <hi>Royan,</hi> and the Treaty commenced by <hi>La Force,</hi> they were remitted to the Queen-Mother, who ſtayed at <hi>Nantes,</hi> and from thence to the Chancellour at <hi>Paris,</hi> ſo that they returned without having effected any thing: The King keeping on his way in <hi>Guienne,</hi> concludes the Treaty with <hi>La Force,</hi> who for a Marſhal of <hi>France</hi> his ſtaff, and two hundred thouſand crowns gave up <hi>Saint Foy,</hi> which he had injuriouſly gotten, and detained from <hi>Terbon Pardaillan</hi>'s ſon in law: And he, and his ſons gave up all the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and Governments they enjoyed, without the privity of the Aſſembly general or the Duke of <hi>Rohan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>While this Treaty was in agitation, <hi>Tonneins,</hi> after a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome defence, was ſurrendred to the Duke <hi>d' Elbeuf;</hi> and <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zignan</hi> made a particular compoſition for <hi>Clerac,</hi> which he yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alſo, ſo that the King came to <hi>Saint Antonin</hi> without any other oppoſition: The Inhabitants of <hi>Montauban,</hi> mindful of the good Offices they had received from thoſe of <hi>Saint Antonin,</hi> though they feared they ſhould disfurniſh themſelves of Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170346:43"/>
ſent thither <hi>Saint Sebaſtien</hi> a Captain in <hi>Beaufort</hi>'s Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with what Souldiers they could ſpare to command the place: But his being mortally wounded, in an aſſault made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome out-works, which were carried by main force, together with the ſpringing of ſome Mines, ſo terrified the Inhabitants, that in great confuſion, and ſo ſuddenly yielded they the Town, that two hundred men, which they deſired from <hi>Montauban,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by <hi>Salce,</hi> and <hi>Rouſſeliere</hi> found the place taken, where they were quietly let in by the enemy who ſtabbed many of them, before the reſt could perceive that the place was loſt. But at length diſcovering their error, they ſaved themſelves the beſt they could; <hi>Salce</hi> and <hi>Rouſſeliere</hi> were taken, and not releaſed but by the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Peace.</p>
               <p>Thoſe of <hi>Montauban</hi> fearing that from <hi>Saint Antonin</hi> the next viſit would be to them, ſollicited the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> for a Governour, and ſome ſupplies of men, who ſent them <hi>Saint An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre de Montbrun,</hi> who with great courage, and equal fortune made way for himſelf and five Hundred Men into the Town.</p>
               <p>The King's approach to the higher <hi>Languedoc</hi> greatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartned the whole party, and gave thoſe that were falſe among them an occaſion to renew their intelligences; Every Town in particular, ſent the ſame harſh meſſage to the Duke, that unleſs he preſently repair thither, the whole Countrey will be given up. This caſt him into many anxious perplexities; for if he goes not whither he is called, the Countrey is loſt; and if he does go, he leaves the lower <hi>Lauguedoc</hi> to a manifeſt hazard, where his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence would give <hi>Chastillon</hi> an opportunity to revive his factions and conſpiracies: And on the other ſide the Duke <hi>de Leſdigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eres</hi> preſſes him with reiterated ſummons to a ſecond interview: At length he reſolves to relieve thoſe that were moſt neceſſitated, excuſes himſelf to <hi>Leſdiguieres,</hi> ſends a renfort of Souldiers to <hi>Montpellier,</hi> to preſerve their fields from ravage, by reaſon that the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> had received a recruit of five Troops of light Horſe, which <hi>Zamet</hi> brought him from the King's Army, and gives order for the levying of a thouſand men for the higher <hi>Languedoc;</hi> whither as he was going with his own attendants on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Chauve,</hi> Miniſter of the Church of <hi>Sommiers,</hi> a man of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary piety, and ſingular eloquence, comes to him at <hi>Saint John de Gardonnenque,</hi> and tells him that he knew, and that by very good information, that <hi>Chastillon,</hi> much diſpleaſed with himſelf for his former actions, was ſore troubled to ſee the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent ruine of thoſe of the Religion, whom, but for the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts he had received, he had never deſerted; and was confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170346:44"/>
that if he were handſomely dealt with, he would return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the party; to the great advantage of it, both by reaſon of the conſideration of his perſon, eſpecially in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and of the conſequence of the Town of <hi>Aiguemortes,</hi> which was in his hands. This was a device of <hi>Chaſtillon</hi>'s confederates, who, knowing the reputation of this Miniſter, had abuſed him with theſe hopes, that the Dukes refuſal to admit of him, might fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them with more ſpecious pretences on which to ground their detractions and new calumnies againſt him; which the Duke very well foreſeeing, anſwers, That he was ſo farre from diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his good intentions, or hindring a work of ſo general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, as the regaining ſuch a perſon to their party, that, on the contrary, in any thing tending to their advantage, he would meet him more than half way: As for the command con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on him, by reaſon of the other's abſenting himſelf from the Province, as he had never ſued for it, ſo neither was he ſo fond of it, as not to yield it up, whenever the Province that gave it him ſhould think fit to revoke it; and that he wiſhed with all his heart, that he would ſeriouſly and in good earneſt, comply with his duty to his own, and the publick Intereſts; that for his part, he was contented with the command aſſigned him by the general Aſſembly at <hi>Rochell,</hi> in the upper <hi>Guienne,</hi> and the upper <hi>Languedoc,</hi> whither he was now going to provide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the dangers the King's approach gave them cauſe to feare, leaving the way open for <hi>Chaſtillon</hi> to return to thoſe he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore forſaken: However the duty he owed both to his imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and conſcience, obliged him to ſay, that there were yet many things in this caſe to be conſidered, and that the Province ought maturely to weigh, and every one in particular ſtrictly to examine the importance and conſequences of this affair, and principally <hi>Chauve</hi> himſelf, both by reaſon of his profeſſion, and the charge he had now undertaken: But that the infallible tryal of his ſincerity would be, whether he would effectively deliver up into the hands of the Province, the Town of <hi>Aiguemortes;</hi> for that if his pretences to ſerve the party were real and ſincere, he would make no difficulty of it, but if feigned and fallacious, he would never diſ-poſſeſſe himſelf of it: <hi>Chauve</hi> very well approved the motion, believing he would accept of it; and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned.</p>
               <p>The Duke foreſeeing that in his abſence this buſineſs would be moved again, gave an eſpecial charge to <hi>Dupuy</hi> (whom he left his Agent in that Province) to take great heed, that nothing paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed there, to the prejudice of the publick or his Intereſt; to which end he gave him ſufficient power, and inſtructions, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170346:44"/>
chiefly to this, that if this propoſition were ſtarted in any Aſſembly whatſoever, and that they ſhould proceed to Treat on it with out the precedent condition, to wit, that the Gariſon of <hi>Aiguemortes</hi> ſhould be firſt reſtored to the diſpoſal of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, he ſhould oppoſe it; and if they Treated on thoſe termes, he ſhould ſee that there were no foul play uſed, and that nothing were concluded without a previous performance of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
               <p>This done, he proceeds in his journey to the higher <hi>Langue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc,</hi> and arrives there juſt upon the taking of <hi>Saint Antonin,</hi> and ſo opportunely, that he prevented the Rendition of <hi>Lombez</hi> and <hi>Realmont,</hi> and revives the drooping and almoſt decayed ſpirits of the whole Countrey, in which he loſt nothing but <hi>Carmaing, Saint Espuel,</hi> and <hi>Cuc<expan>

               <p>The King ſeeing, that the Countrey reſumed their courages, advances further, carried on with the hopes the Duke of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morency</hi> and <hi>Chaſtillon</hi> gave him, and chiefly of <hi>Montpellier,</hi> ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all his Ammunition down the <hi>Rhone</hi> to the lower <hi>Languedoc; Blaccons</hi> revolt, who ſold <hi>Baye</hi> to the King for twenty thouſand Crowns, having opened the paſſage of that River: The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> on the other ſide gets before them, and enters <hi>Montpelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> at the ſame time the King got into <hi>Beziers;</hi> leaving a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot with <hi>Malauze</hi> to aſſiſt him againſt the Duke of <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſme,</hi> whom the King had left with an Army in the higher <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc,</hi> as he had alſo the Marſhal <hi>Themines</hi> with other Troops a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Montauban.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About the ſame time came a Gentleman to the Duke of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han,</hi> from the Duke of <hi>Boüillon,</hi> with credential Letters, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting alſo his reſentments of the miſeries of thoſe of the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that he thought a Peace would have been concluded at <hi>Saint John;</hi> and afterwards at <hi>Montauban,</hi> that, ſince that he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that he and the Duke <hi>de Leſdiguieres</hi> were in Treaty about it, that he adviſed him to conclude it upon any terms, provided it were general; for that being not able to diſpute the field with the King, for want of forraign aſſiſtance, their deſtruction, though it might be retarded, would yet be inevitable, and that the longer the peace was deferred, the more diſadvantageous would it be: Nevertheleſs if it was our ruine, that they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterably decreed, that he would take the field with what forces he could make, to aſſiſt the party by a conſiderable diverſion of the enemy; that he was in Treaty with Count <hi>Mansfeid,</hi> and that he deſired three things of the Duke: Firſt, that he would
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170346:45"/>
impower him to Treat with Forraigners: Secondly, that he, and the Provinces under his command, ſhould oblige themſelves to bear an equal ſhare of the charge of the Levyes: Thirdly, that no Peace ſhould be concluded without him; all which Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were aſſented to, and the Gentleman returned well ſatisfied, having alſo received a faithful aſſurance, that if the peace were not made by the firſt of <hi>September,</hi> it ſhould not be concluded with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, provided that with in the time limited he were certified of his acceptance of the conditions.</p>
               <p>In the abſence of the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> from the lower <hi>Langue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc,</hi> the Council of that Province, compoſed at that time of the Deputies of the three Towns of <hi>Montpellier, Niſmess</hi> and <hi>Uſez,</hi> imagining that ſince <hi>Saint Antonin</hi> was taken, they might be the next the King would invade, and that though the fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Montpellier</hi> were already well advanced, yet was it unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided of men and proviſions, conceived it neceſſary to aſſemble the whole body of the Province, to order all; and <hi>Lunel</hi> was the place deſigned for the Aſſembly to be kept at; where when all the Deputies with <hi>Dupuy</hi> were met, and had debated, and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on what concerned the victualling and ſecuring of <hi>Montpelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> and other places in caſe they ſhould be beſieged; the adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of <hi>Chaſtillon,</hi> of which there were many preſent, having made their party, thinking to make their advantage of this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, produced againe the Articles for his re-eſtabliſhment: The Deputies of the three Towns, voluntarily, and of themſelves oppoſed this overture, for fear of falling into the hands, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the command of one, they had ſo highly offended, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſting him of his charge; Proteſting to the Aſſembly, that if they aſſumed any other debate than what concerned the executing of the Decrees already paſt, for the relief of <hi>Montpellier,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, they would utterly deſert them, and diſavow all their future determinations; <hi>Dupuy</hi> in obedience to the command he had received, ſeconded this oppoſition, which <hi>Berticheres</hi> (Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator of the Aſſembly, as being the Duke's Lieutenant Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral) alſo much countenanced, alledging, that they had no power to Aſſemble, in the abſence, and without the permiſſion of their General; and that though they were now convened, yet was it with his good leave and approbation, and upon the preſent exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of affairs, of which they had given him an account, and that this neceſſity being now taken off, they ought to forbear the debate of other particular matters, till his return.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs the confederates aforeſaid reſolutely perſiſted in their deſign, renforcing every day their ſollicitations, with hopes to procure at length a reſumption of the ſuſpended debate,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170346:45"/>
and to carry it by plurality of voices, or at leaſt by this means to take off <hi>Lunel, Aimargues,</hi> and <hi>Mauguio,</hi> which adhering to <hi>Chaſtillon,</hi> would raiſe his eſteem at Court; of which when the Deputies of the th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> Towns, and <hi>Dupuy</hi> had notice, they reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that at the firſt mention of it, they would object the intereſt of the Province of the <hi>Sevenes,</hi> which being a part of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the lower <hi>Languedoc,</hi> it muſt needs be prejudicial to the common repoſe of both the Provinces, to determine that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, without the others intervention or privity; wherefore they ſent a true account of all that had paſſed to the Council of that Province then ſitting at <hi>Anduze,</hi> together with their advice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning what they conceived ought to be done by them in the behalf of their Province: The ſame Deputies alſo, with <hi>Dupuy,</hi> went to <hi>Berticheres</hi> to make ſure of him, who faithfully promiſed to continue immoveable in his oppoſition. In the ſucceeding Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions there were ſtill ſome words thrown out by <hi>Chaſtillon</hi>'s friends, concerning that ſubject, but they paſſed unregarded. In the mean while came the Deputies from the Aſſembly of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of the <hi>Sevenes,</hi> who made a large Remonſtrance of the injuries their Province would receive from the change they would introduce in their proceedings, that it was an unheard of proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, and that their Province could never ſuffer, that that of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> ſhould by it ſelf preſume to abrogate the Decrees of the Aſſembly of the Circle, or five Provinces, in which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties of the Aſſembly of the <hi>Sevenes</hi> had a joynt concurrence of Votes with thoſe of the lower <hi>Languedoc;</hi> and moreover repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Aſſembly their own Intereſts, and the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences would enſue their ſubmitting themſelves to the power and conduct of a man, whom they had ſo highly provoked, by the ſuſpicions they had of him; and in the laſt place proteſted, That in caſe the Aſſembly ſhould proceed further, in the abſence of the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> or without his conſent and approbation, they would abſolutely diſclaim them.</p>
               <p>This oppoſition of the Deputies of the Council of the <hi>Sevenes,</hi> ſeconded by thoſe of the three Towns, grounded upon their own, and the large Commiſſion, and power of <hi>Dupuy</hi> ſomething cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the heat of thoſe ſollicitours, which yet in a ſhort time after they reſumed again; and importuned <hi>Chauve</hi> anew, to proſecute what he had begun; which he would by no means undertake, without imparting it to <hi>Dupuy;</hi> who after he had remembred him, upon what terms he had parted with the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> at <hi>Saint John de Gardonnenque,</hi> tells him that he would conſider of it, and then give him his anſwer; and in the mean time had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference about it with the Deputies of the three Towns, who thought
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170346:46"/>
it not unfit that <hi>Chauve,</hi> as of himſelf, and without any particular Commiſſion, ſhould ſound <hi>Chaſtillon</hi>'s inclinations, to diſcover whether he would yield to that condition of delivering up <hi>Aigue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortes</hi> into the hands of the Province, which was then very op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunely met, to receive both it, and him, with all aſſurance he could deſire of an Amneſty, and the continuance of their reſpects to him: It being moſt apparant, that <hi>Chaſtillon,</hi> who they knew deſired nothing more than to intrude himſelf among us, only to render himſelf more conſiderable, and his Intereſts more favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at Court, would never disfurniſh himſelf of the only means left him, to procure a performance of the promiſes made him, and that thus they ſhould alſo make him deſiſt from his purſuit. When they had given <hi>Chauve</hi> their anſwer in theſe termes, he approved of it; and promiſed to comport himſelf according to their directions; and thereupon had a conference with <hi>Banſillon</hi> the Miniſter of <hi>Aiguemortes,</hi> who highly magnified the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges this re-eſtabliſhment of <hi>Chaſtillon</hi> would produce to their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in general: To whom <hi>Chauve</hi> replyed, That it would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to efface the impreſſions <hi>Chastillon</hi>'s procedures had left in the whole Province, unleſs he ſupplied them with the means he had in his hands, by yielding up the Town of <hi>Aiguemortes</hi> to their diſpoſal; which if he would do, they would evidence the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment they had, to ſee a perſon of his quality return into the way from which he had digreſſed, by their promptneſs to ſerve and honour him, as they had formerly done: This diſcourſe pleaſed not <hi>Banſillon</hi> at all, who told him, that he conceived that <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stillon</hi> neither would, nor ought to conſent to this Propoſition; that he had good reaſon to take heed of falling into thoſe ſnares he knew were ſpread for him; for that having deveſted him of all power, they might the more eaſily diſpoſe of him at their pleaſure, or at leaſt pay all his former ſervice with the cold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of Oblivion, or neglect; and that therefore he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Treaty abſolutely broken: Upon which, as <hi>Chauve</hi> was about to leave him, he told him, that he would give <hi>Chastillon</hi> an account of all, and him an anſwer the next day at the ſame place; which he did, and in effect conformable to his own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceptions; which abſolutely cleared the judgement of <hi>Chauve,</hi> and many others alſo, when he had given the Aſſembly a Summary of this conference.</p>
               <p>In the mean while the Deputies of the three Towns inceſſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſollicited <hi>Dupuy,</hi> to preſs the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi>'s return, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to him the condition of the Province, and the danger it was in of being ruined by the diviſions ſprung from this late Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and the delay his abſence occaſioned in the progreſs of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170346:46"/>
their affaires: Whereupon <hi>Dupuy</hi> reſolved, to make a journey himſelf to the Duke of <hi>Rohan:</hi> But yet he would not leave the Aſſembly, before he had gotten a promiſe from <hi>Berticheres,</hi> that there ſhould be no more mention made of the aforeſaid re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment for eight dayes, by which time he ſhould return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain from <hi>Niſmes</hi> whither he pretended he was going; but in the mean time he goes by great journeys towards the Duke, whom he found at <hi>Pont de Camares,</hi> who having received from him an account of all paſſages, quitted all other things to return with all poſſible ſpeed to the lower <hi>Languedoc:</hi> When he was come to <hi>Mirveis,</hi> he ſent a Gentleman, with command to travel night and day to the Aſſembly, to let them know that he was within two days journey of them, and deſired them to ſuſpend all further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates concerning their affairs, till his arrival.</p>
               <p>This unexpected news ſurprized the Aſſembly ſo, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of continuing their conſultations, they went to meet him as farre as <hi>Sommieres,</hi> where when he had learned of them, what or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der they had taken for the raiſing of Souldiers, and ſupplying the Gariſons with neceſſaries, he ratified what they had done, and ſo diſmiſſed them.</p>
               <p>Thus ended this tentative of <hi>Chastillon's</hi> friends to reſtore him to a repute with the Party: After which <hi>Rohan</hi> went to <hi>Montpellier,</hi> where he turned fifteen or ſixteen of his chiefeſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidents out of the Town, and ordered all things neceſſary (as before he had done at <hi>Montauban</hi>) for a ſiege, both for ammunition, victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, and the fortifications.</p>
               <p>It is to be obſerved, that in the Duke's abſence, <hi>Americ</hi> the firſt Conſul of <hi>Montpellier,</hi> and <hi>Carlincas</hi> his Kinſman, took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion upon a defeat of two or three companies, near to <hi>Perolles,</hi> which <hi>Saint André</hi> had ſent thither, while the enemy was plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Countrey thereabouts, to accuſe him to the people, who had already a jealouſie of him; and <hi>Berticheres,</hi> thoug his father-in-law, inſtead of aſſiſting him, helped to thruſt him out of the Town; not out of any affection to the cauſe, but of a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilent ambition raigned among them; every one labouring to raiſe his own advantages upon the ruines of others, and better their conditions by delivering <hi>Montpellier</hi> to the King: But the ſeventeen dayes ſtay the Duke made there, and the diſcovery he made, by a Meſſenger of the Preſident <hi>Faure,</hi> taken neare <hi>Niſmes,</hi> that <hi>Berticheres</hi> Treated with the King, together with ſome Colonels, who were ordered for the defence of <hi>Montpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier;</hi> and the execution of <hi>Bimart,</hi> who was one of them, reduced things to a better poſture; But yet theſe diſorders re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded the Levyes, ſo that of foure thouſand Souldiers deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:170346:47"/>
for the defence of the Town, they got in but fifteen hundred.</p>
               <p>It is moreover to be noted, that the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> ſeeing the great want of Ammunition in the Province of lower <hi>Langue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc,</hi> and of time, and means to fortifie all their Gariſons, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the diſmantling of them, and the reducing of their forces to <hi>Montpellier, Niſmes, Uſez,</hi> and <hi>Sommieres;</hi> which the people then rejected, but have ſince, though too late, repented it; for their obſtinacy drew upon them the loſs both of their Eſtates and Liberties; for whiles they vainly trifled away their time and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, in fortifying ſo many places, neither of them was fortified or defended as it ought, but both they, and the reliefs ſent to them, which in the other places would have been of great uſe, were now made wholly unſerviceable.</p>
               <p>The King ſeeing that the care and diligence of the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> had defeated all the deſignes of thoſe that would have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up <hi>Montpellier</hi> to him, ſtaid ſome time at <hi>Beziers</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect his Ammunitions, and to recruit his Army: And in the mean time ſent the Marſhal <hi>de Praſlin</hi> to beſiege <hi>Bedarieux,</hi> which he took, and diſmantled; and then ſent the Duke of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morency</hi> to take in <hi>Mauguio,</hi> which the inhabitants knew not how to defend, nor yet would they quit it, nor ſpoyle the wines, as the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> had commanded them.</p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> about this time came to the King's Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and thence went to beſiege <hi>Lunel</hi> and <hi>Maſſillargues,</hi> within half a League one of another, and ſufficiently ſtored with all neceſſaries, there being in <hi>Lunel</hi> two Colonels beſides the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, who all joyntly wrote to the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> that if he would ſend them in but five hundred Souldiers, they would give a handſome account of the place: The Duke, when he had ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Calonges</hi> in <hi>Montpellier,</hi> and left <hi>Dupuy</hi> his Agent there, in his name to provide all things requiſite for the defence of the Town, went purpoſely to prepare the deſired ſupply, and ſent them in eight hundred men; but much to their regret; for the next day, though they had not ſuffered any the leaſt extremity, and that the breach made was not conſiderable, they yielded themſelves with all their Arms, and Baggage. Thoſe of <hi>Maſſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largues</hi> had done the like but a few dayes before: But the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of <hi>Lunel</hi> were violated even before the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s face; for when the Gariſon marched out, they were beaten, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed, ſtript, and a great part of them killed or maimed; and in this lamentable poſture went they to <hi>Niſmes</hi> and <hi>Sommieres,</hi> on which they brought ſo great a terror, that upon the appearance of the enemy before <hi>Sommieres,</hi> in which there were fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:170346:47"/>
men, they did even as bad as thoſe of <hi>Lunel;</hi> and, which is a moſt ſhameful thing to be related, the Captains took two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crowns, to leave their arms to the enemy.</p>
               <p>The Town of <hi>Niſmes</hi> alarmed by theſe ſad accidents, ſent Meſſengers to requeſt a viſit from the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> which he willingly condeſcended to, but firſt got together as many Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as he could at <hi>Anduze,</hi> which he left under the Command of <hi>Charce</hi> his Lieutenant General in the <hi>Sevenes,</hi> and of the Adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant General, who when they ſaw the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the <hi>Sevenes,</hi> drew into a body about a quarter of a League from <hi>Anduze,</hi> at a Paſs not eaſily acceſſible, which they fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and had not their care and diligence in furniſhing <hi>Sauve</hi> and <hi>Aletz</hi> with two valiant and expert Commanders, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, or twelve hundred Souldiers, drawn out of <hi>Saint Hyppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite,</hi> and the places adjacent prevented it, thoſe two Towns had been alſo loſt: So that the good poſture they were in, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi>'s obſtructing of <hi>Montmorency</hi>'s pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, which came a great way off, forced him, after a ſucceſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs voyage, to return again.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Marſhal <hi>Themines</hi> plundred all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey about <hi>Montauban,</hi> burnt all their Countrey houſes, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed their Vintage: But all this hindred not <hi>Saint Andre de Montbrun,</hi> their Governour, from drawing out his Canon, and battering, and taking many Caſtles, among others, <hi>Renié,</hi> and <hi>la Bastide,</hi> and ſtoring his Town with Corne and Wine for a whole yeare: He had alſo ſeveral Skirmiſhes with the Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Montech,</hi> and others alſo, and ſtill came off with honour and advantage.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Vendoſme</hi> alſo with ſeven thouſand Foot, and five hundred Horſe, ſate down before <hi>Lombez; Malauze</hi> comes to <hi>Realmont</hi> with intention to relieve it; but conceiving it not te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable againſt ſuch a force, by reaſon of the weakneſs of the Town, and that the Caſtle which commanded it, was Gariſon'd by the enemy; contented himſelf after a long Skirmiſh, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing off the Souldiers, as well inhabitants, as ſtrangers; and abandons the town, which was burnt. From <hi>Lombez</hi> the Duke marches to beſiege <hi>Briteſte,</hi> a little place, weak of it ſelf, and commanded almoſt on every ſide: Thither <hi>Malauze</hi> ſent five hundred men under the Command of <hi>Faucon,</hi> one of <hi>Seſigny</hi>'s Captains, who behaved himſelf very gallantly: He endured the Siege a month or more, beat them off in four or five aſſaults, was twice relieved with freſh ſupplies of men and powder; by <hi>Malauze,</hi> whoſe main body lay at <hi>Saint Paul</hi> and <hi>Miatte,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a League and half from <hi>Briteſte,</hi> and never had more than
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:170346:48"/>
two thouſand Foot, and two hundred Voluntiers on Horſe-back, with whom, and by the means of the brave reſiſtance of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged, he did ſo well, that the Duke of <hi>Vendoſme,</hi> being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the King to come, and joyn his Porces with the Army that lay before <hi>Montpellier,</hi> raiſed the ſiege after he had ſpent two thouſand Canon bullets on them, and loſt fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of his men; and thoſe within the town three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.</p>
               <p>The departure of this Army, freed the whole Country from much harm, and greater fears; and invites us to return to the lover <hi>Languedoc,</hi> where the Duke <hi>de Leſdiguieres,</hi> having exchanged his Religion for the honour to be made Conſtable of <hi>France,</hi> conceiving himſelf more capable now, than heretofore, to procure a Peace, ſollicites the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> to another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview, who ſeeing the hopes he had grounded on the Count <hi>Mansfield,</hi> who was gone into <hi>Holland,</hi> had failed him, the more willingly complies with his deſires. They met at <hi>Saint Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vas,</hi> where they agreed on all things, except the King's entry into <hi>Montpellier;</hi> whereupon he obliged the Duke to a journey to the Town, to propoſe it to them, with all poſſible aſſurances, they ſhould deſire, to teſtifie, that they intended not the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringement of their liberties: But this to be done without any ceſſation of Arms, nor was the Duke allowed more than two dayes ſtay there, to perfect this negotiation; who, conſidering the danger <hi>Montpellier</hi> was in, unleſs ſupplied with a new renfort of Souldiers; for that the works being not finiſhed, their defects were to be made up with an addition of more men, ſends expreſs Orders to his Adjutant General <hi>Sorle,</hi> to draw twelve hundred men, out of the two thouſand he had with much adoe detained at <hi>Anduze,</hi> and by the Valley of <hi>Montferrant</hi> conduct them to <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellier,</hi> the night enſuing the evening that he ſhould get in there: But when the Captains and Souldiers knew that they were to be ſocked up in <hi>Montpellier,</hi> they all deſerted the Adjutant, who came thither accompanied only with fifteen.</p>
               <p>Thoſe of <hi>Montpellier</hi> would by no means admit of the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition concerning the King's entry into their Town, fearing a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of their liberties, by reaſon of the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities againſt them; which the Duke perceiving, encourages them to ſtand bravely upon their defence, aſſuring them that he would provide for their relief, in which, for his part, he omitted nothing that might forward it: But as there is a vaſt difference between the promiſes, and payment of money, ſo inſtead of ten days, within which time he thought to have ſent them aid, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his journeys to <hi>Niſmes, Uſez,</hi> and the <hi>Sevenes,</hi> not
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:170346:48"/>
without manifeſt hazard of his perſon, could he not, under five weeks, get four thouſand men together; nor thoſe neither with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out engaging himſelf by promiſes to moſt of the Captains; that they were not to be ſent to <hi>Montpellier,</hi> but only that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of their numbers might procure them a more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous Peace: So great was their conſternation; and thoſe that were deſirous to get thither, were yet deterred by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the difficulties, which really were very great; the King having then an Army conſiſting of twenty thouſand Foot, and three thouſand Horſe; for the Conſtable, and the Duke of <hi>Vendoſme</hi> had now joyned their's with the other Forces; beſides, ſo great a way were they to go, and ſuch difficult paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes had they to get through, that it was impoſſible to approach within three Leagues of the Town, without encountring the King's whole Cavalry; and moreover ſo great a ſcarcity was there of Proviiſions, that they could not keep the Troops together, more than eight or ten dayes: Thoſe of <hi>Montpellier</hi> of the other ſide, could no longer ſubſiſt for want of men, by reaſon of the exceſſive duty they were on, and therefore every moment ſent they moſt important Letters for relief: To which may be added alſo a new Summons ſent him by the Conſtable, who had before left the Court in ſome diſcontent for that he could not prevaile to obtain a Peace; yet now at his return was he in higher e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem, both by reaſon of the Forces he had brought with him, and that the Prince, in his abſence, had nothing advanced the Siege: All which the Duke conſidering, and that he was utterly deſtitute of hopes of any Forraign aſſiſtance, having newly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Letter from the King of <hi>England</hi> preſſing him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a Peace, and ſeeing no probability of any good to be done at home; every one being weary of the War, and labouring to purchaſe his own particular ſafety, with the expence of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Intereſt; that the firſt Town ſhould fall off, and embrace a particular Treaty, would totally fruſtrate all endeavours for a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Peace; that the leaſt croſs accident ſhould happen to <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellier,</hi> or the relief intended for it, would be irreparable; that the King could not want men, the Duke of <hi>Angouleſme</hi> being then at <hi>Lions</hi> with a recruit of eight, or ten thouſand; and that, without a miracle, <hi>Montpellier</hi> could not be preſerved: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, ſeeing that there were about the King two powerful par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; the one preſſing the concluſion of a Peace, the other, the continuation of the War; and that the former could not ſubſiſt without a Peace, no more than the other without a War; and that the Chief of the latter, to wit, the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> had deſerted the Court upon the Compoſure of former differences,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:170346:49"/>
he conceived that thoſe that promoted the Peace being alwayes neare the King, would take care to ſee it faithfully obſerved: This made him reſolve upon another conference with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, at which the Duke of <hi>Chevreuſe</hi> was preſent; where all was concluded according to the Declarations and Breviates drawn up to that purpoſe: Which when the King acquainted the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> with, he left the Court; and the Duke of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han,</hi> with the Deputies of the <hi>Sevenes, Niſmes,</hi> and <hi>Uſez,</hi> went to <hi>Montpellier,</hi> where they all confirmed the Peace; the ſubſtance of the principal Articles of which was, as followeth:

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Peace thus concluded, the Prince gone from the Court, and his Faction, by his abſence, and the death of the Cardinal <hi>de Retz</hi> quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed, every one began to have fair hopes of its continuance, and that, grown wiſe by our former miſcarriages, we ſhould now renounce all future thoughts of Civil broyles, and mind the Protection of the ancient Allyes of the Crown: But the beams of favour now reflecting ſolely on <hi>Puizieux,</hi> a man of a hot ſpirit, and whoſe whole ingenuity conſiſted in tricks and fallacies, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more ſtudious of his own, than his Maſters geatneſſe (a vice incident to all favourites) being carefull to raiſe himſelf ſome props at <hi>Rome,</hi> and very unwilling to give <hi>Spaine</hi> the leaſt diſguſt;
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:170346:51"/>
So that all Leagues with other forraigne Princes, were made with ſuch reſpect to thoſe two powers, as if we ſtood in fear of their diſpleaſure: Nay, and to ſooth the Popes <hi>Nuncio,</hi> who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes oppoſed the Peace, at the very beginning of it, would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to ſhew him, that it was not made to abate the preſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but to promote the ruine of thoſe of the Reformed Religion. For immediately after the King's entry into <hi>Montpellier,</hi> the ſenſe of the general Grant was inverted in moſt places of it, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ſeveral Remonſtrances the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> made to oppoſe it: Nor were the Souldiers drawn away from <hi>Montpellier,</hi> though promiſed to be done immediately after the King's depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; then was it put off, till his return from <hi>Provence,</hi> then, till he came to <hi>Avignon,</hi> and laſtly till he ſhould be at <hi>Lions;</hi> whence the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> having followed him to all thoſe places, urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their departure very earneſtly, and perhaps too boldly, telling the King they ſhould deſiſt from farther razing the fortifications, if he revoked that command, returned with a Letter to <hi>Valence,</hi> commanding him expreſly to do it. Nor did they forbear in their march through <hi>Dauphine</hi> to ſeize upon all the places that were in the hands of thoſe of the Religion, though they had ſerved the Kings party, the only recompence they had for fighting againſt their conſciences, nor were any but thoſe only, that were poſſeſſed by the Conſtable, exempt from this violence, which yet he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved with much difficulty, for had not the Marſhal <hi>Crequi</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to deliver them up after his death, they had then gone the ſame way with the reſt. At <hi>Lions</hi> the Deputies of <hi>Rochelle</hi> came to wait upon the King, whence they carried back Letters to <hi>Arnaud</hi> Governour of <hi>Fort Lewis,</hi> commanding him, that within eight dayes after the <hi>Rochellers</hi> had performed what the Articles had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned them, as concerning the demolition of their fortifications, he ſhould cauſe the ſaid Fort to be ſlighted alſo: but <hi>Arnaud</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived another of the ſame date, but a cleare contrary ſence.</p>
               <p>When the King went from <hi>Lions,</hi> towards <hi>Paris,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> returned to <hi>Languedoc,</hi> really and ſincerely to execute, what ever had been promiſed in the name of thoſe of the Religion, touching that part of their fortifications they ought to ſlight. Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Montpellier,</hi> he found the Conſulate of the Merchants changed, of which he complains to the Court, but in vaine: He delivers the Kings Letter to <hi>Valence,</hi> who promiſed to obey it; from thence he goes to <hi>Niſmes</hi> and <hi>Uſez,</hi> whom he preſently ſets on work; thence to the higher <hi>Languedoc, Montauban, Foix,</hi> and <hi>Roüergue,</hi> where at a conference with the Duke of <hi>Ventadour,</hi> the Count of <hi>Carmaine,</hi> the Preſident <hi>de Caminade,</hi> and the Count

                  <hi>d' Aquien,</hi> Commiſſioners, as he was for the demoliſhing the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications, all things were agreed on between them and he for his part inſtantly ſet about them, delivering up alſo all Forts, and Towns that had been taken in the Warre, reſtoring alſo the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion to thoſe places, where it had been formerly uſed.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding all which <hi>Valence,</hi> who, beſides the four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men were in <hi>Montpellier,</hi> had four or five Regiments more, and three or four troops of light horſe, had deſigned to ſurprize, with theſe the <hi>Sevenes</hi> under pretence of taking up quarters there, and by means of ſome correſpondencies he had gotten among them; of which when the Duke had notice, from the principal Communalties of the <hi>Sevenes,</hi> who ſent him their complaints of this infringement of the Peace, he wrote to them back again for anſwer, that he knew it was not the Kings pleaſure, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that they ſhould not receive them; and to <hi>Valencé</hi> that he ſhould forbear thoſe quarters till his arrival, leaſt otherwiſe it ſhould prejudice the eſtabliſhment of the Peace: The Duke of <hi>Ventadour,</hi> the Count <hi>de Carmaine,</hi> and the Preſident <hi>de Caminade</hi> wrote to him to the ſame effect; which he regarded not, but proceeded in his enterpriſe, the Towns of <hi>Sauve,</hi> and <hi>Gange</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his Troops, but all the other places, upon the Duke of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han</hi>'s Letter refuſed them: The Duke when he had put things in ſuch a forwardneſſe in the higher <hi>Languedoc,</hi> returns to <hi>Montpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi> according to the agreement between him, and <hi>Valencé:</hi> But he was no ſooner entred the Town, than made a Priſoner, and kept with a ſevere guard upon him: This cauſed a great aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in many, who could not imagine that this ſhould be done without order; but being known at Court, it was not approved of there, for fear leſt it ſhould prove too great an obſtruction to the raiſing of the fortifications; ſo that his liberty was preſently ordered.</p>
               <p>Whiles the Duke was under this reſtraint, <hi>Valence,</hi> contrary to the Articles of the Peace, divides the Conſulate of <hi>Montpellier</hi> between thoſe of the Religion and the Papiſts, and to effect it, uſed all manner of violence to the old Conſuls, detaining them as priſoners one whole night in his own lodgings.</p>
               <p>The Court gave the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> no better ſatisfaction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this, than the former breach of the Peace; receiving, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of relief, advice, that to avoid the ſuſpitions the lower <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc</hi> had of him, he ſhould remove to the higher, to execute the remaining part of his Commiſſion: For <hi>Puyſieux</hi> brother-in-law to <hi>Valencé,</hi> having caſhiered <hi>Schomberg,</hi> and reſtored the Chancellour his Father, was now the only powerful man, and by
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170346:52"/>
drawing falſe gloſſes upon all the actions of <hi>Valence</hi> improved them all to his advantage, and upon all occaſions thwarted the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> clouding all his attempts with inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and ſiniſter interpretations and jealouſies: And yet upon the anſwer the Duke ſent that he would not leave <hi>Niſmes,</hi> nor the <hi>Sevenes</hi> till they were rid of thoſe Troops that lay upon them, he quickly received an order to diſmiſſe them: After which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted towards the lower <hi>Languedoc,</hi> leaving thoſe of <hi>Niſmes</hi> very much unſatisfied of him, out of a perſwaſion that he was of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence with the Court, and privie to all the violations of the Peace, and that his impriſonment was not real, but a deluſory trick to palliate his other practices; The uſual recompence per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of quality and honour derive from ſervices done to the people.</p>
               <p>When he came to <hi>Millaud</hi> he was informed, that the Duke <hi>d' Espernou</hi> had written to all the Towns held by thoſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in <hi>Roüergue,</hi> to ſend him Deputies both of the one, and the other Religion, and that they ſhould not proceed to the Election of their Conſuls, (who are uſually choſen at <hi>Whitſuntide</hi>) before they had from him known the King's pleaſure therein; this cauſed a great confuſion among them; but by the advice of the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> they proceed, notwithſtanding, to their Elections, at the accuſtomed time, according to the Declaration of Peace, which imports, that in the Conſulary Towns, held by thoſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, nothing ſhall be innovated; and then ſent their Deputies to the Duke <hi>d' Espernon</hi> to know what his pleaſure was: Avoiding by this means, the injury intended to the Peace, and them in this particular.</p>
               <p>This done, he goes to <hi>Caſtres,</hi> where he fixes his reſidence, and thence ſends the King a perfect account of the entire execution of his Commiſſion; humbly beſeeching him, that, according to his Royal promiſe, the diſgarriſoning of <hi>Montpellier,</hi> the demolition of the Fort <hi>Lewis,</hi> and the re-eſtabliſhing of the Chamber (or Court erected in favour of thoſe of the Reformed Religion) at <hi>Caſtres,</hi> might be no longer deferred: But inſtead of receiving Juſtice thereupon, contrary to the Act of Pacification, verified in ſeveral Parliaments, without any reſtrictions, or limitations, the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments given underhand and Seale, re-iterated by ſeveral Letters, the Anſwer given to the Propoſitions of the Deputies general, and his Majeſties anſwers to the Committee of the Parliament of <hi>Thoulouze,</hi> concerning the Chamber of <hi>Caſtres,</hi> the Garriſon in <hi>Montpellier</hi> was continued, and a Cittadel alſo was erected there, the Fort <hi>Lewis</hi> was re-fortified, and the Chamber was removed to <hi>Bezers:</hi> But this was not all; The Tembles, or Churches of thoſe
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:170346:52"/>
of the Religion were ſtill detained from them; The Parliament of <hi>Thoulouze</hi> made an Ordinance for dividing the <hi>Conſulate</hi> of <hi>Pamiers,</hi> between thoſe of the <hi>Reformed,</hi> and thoſe of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> Religion; vexes and torments particular perſons, by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoning their perſons, and ſequeſtring their eſtates for things they had, according to the tenor of the Declaration, been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempnified for: In ſhort, the preſſures of thoſe of the Religion, ſince the Peace, were far heavier, than thoſe they ſuffered in the time of the war. The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> continues his ſollicitations at Court; and declared his mind ſo freely, that he was forbid any farther to mention of their affairs, it being the King's pleaſure that they thould addreſſe themſelves to the Deputies general, who alſo promiſed with all ſpeed poſſible to ſend Commiſſioners into the Provinces to put the Edict in execution, and redreſſe all their grievances.</p>
               <p>In the mean while the Galleys remained ſtill at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> came up with his Ships to the Iſle of <hi>Re,</hi> which gave a great alarm to <hi>Rochelle,</hi> and made the Duke of <hi>Soubize,</hi> and the Count <hi>de Laval,</hi> to retire alſo to the Town: But this fear was quickly over; the Duke withdrawing thence, and ſayling with his Ships towards <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> followed by the Galleys, whoſe abſence had much prejudiced the trade of <hi>Provence,</hi> imboldning the Pyrates ſo, that they took and carried away their Merchandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes even in ſight of <hi>Marſeilles.</hi> But the King diſcovering much diſpleaſure againſt thoſe that fled in to <hi>Rochelle,</hi> the Count <hi>de La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,</hi> went to make his Apology at Court: But the Duke of <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hize,</hi> conceiving that way not honorable for him; and that his abode in <hi>Poictou,</hi> or <hi>Britany,</hi> could not be with any ſecurity, goes directly to <hi>Caſtres.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let us now look after the Commiſſioners ſent into <hi>Langue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc</hi> to put the Edict in execution; <hi>Favier,</hi> Counſellor of State, and <hi>Saint Privat,</hi> were ſent on this imployment; but, to make ſhort, did nothing, either in the upper, or the lower <hi>Languedoc,</hi> tending to the caſe of thoſe of the Religion; but removing to <hi>Pamiers,</hi> fell into a diviſion concerning the buſineſſe of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulate there, and each of them ſent his opinion, and reaſons to the Court: And thus paſſed the year one thouſand ſix hundred and twenty three.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of the year 1624. <hi>La Vieuville,</hi> whom the Chancellour had advanced to the Super-intendance of the <hi>Finan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> not enduring that his Benefactor ſhould be his Competitour in favour, amongſt other things complains of the diſſervices he and <hi>Puiſieux</hi> had done the State, in preferring the intereſt and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> before that of <hi>France;</hi> and that
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:170346:53"/>
the acceptance of the Articles of Peace touching the affair of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> by the Commander <hi>de Sillery</hi> Embaſſadour at <hi>Rome,</hi> and brother to the Chancellour, was occaſioned by inſtructions, which he (unknown to the King) had received from <hi>France,</hi> to that purpoſe: Whereupon the King, as eaſie to believe the worſt, as hard to believe the beſt of any one, reſolves to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of their Offices, and gives the Seals to <hi>Alligre</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellour of State, and <hi>Puiſieux</hi> his Office of Secretary of State, was ſhared among his other companions; and <hi>Vieuville</hi> remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the only Favourite; who to improve their diſgrace to his fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advantage, cauſed all the Embaſſadours to be changed, placing creatures of his own in their rooms; and had like to have framed a Criminal Proceſs againſt the Chancellour; who in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while after dyed of grief and age; and the Keeper of the Seals was promoted to his place.</p>
               <p>After this, the new Favourite, changing the former Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imes, that he might the better diſcover the male-adminiſtrations, of thoſe whoſe diſgrace he had procured, cauſed the Treaty of the <hi>Valteline</hi> to be diſowned; obtaines another more advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the State; ſets on foot the Marriage of <hi>Madame</hi> the King's Siſter, with the King of <hi>England;</hi> renews the Leagues for the recovery of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> and reſcuing it from the oppreſſion of the <hi>Germanes:</hi> To which end <hi>Bethune</hi> was ſent Embaſſadour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary to <hi>Rome;</hi> the Marqueſs <hi>de Coeuvres</hi> to the <hi>Valte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line; Mansfield</hi> into <hi>Germany</hi> with conſiderable Forces; and the Conſtable with the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> againſt the <hi>Genoeſes.</hi> This diſpoſition of affairs gave fair hopes of great matters, which indeed had very proſperous beginnings.</p>
               <p>And that there might be a good ſtock of money to carry on the Warres, an Inquiſition into the <hi>Financiers</hi> was thought very expedient. And becauſe <hi>Beaumarchais Vieuville</hi>'s Father-in-law was the chiefeſt, and wealthieſt among them, they reſolved to diſgrace him firſt: And in order to it, firſt of all they ſcattered little Paſquils againſt him; afterwards they dealt more boldly, and plainly with him, and every one, prognoſticating, from the violent proſecution of his Father-in-law, that himſelf was not like to continue long, took liberty to exhibit accuſations againſt him alſo, ſo that at length the King commanded him to be arre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, and ſent to <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> where he was kept till he made an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape, without ever knowing the cauſe of his Impriſonment, and is now at his own houſe in full liberty, and ſecurity.</p>
               <p>To this Favourite ſucceeded the Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> who owed his firſt introduction to State employments to his predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour <hi>Vieuville.</hi> See how faithfully theſe Favourites ſerve one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other:
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:170346:53"/>
The King recalls <hi>Schomberg,</hi> and ſets at liberty the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal <hi>d' Ornano,</hi> who by the inſtigation of <hi>Vieuville</hi> had been a little before committed to the <hi>Baſtille.</hi> The ſupport the Cardinal had from the Queen Mother, made his favour more laſting than the others, and encouraged him alſo to greater inſolencies: For the King having a great averſion to the Queen, his Wife, and no leſs a jealouſie of his brother, the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that the Queen his Mother, would be of great uſe to him, to moderate, and compoſe theſe domeſtick jars, which more diſturb the Palaces of great Princes than all their other affairs beſides.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal who now graſped the whole power of <hi>France,</hi> continues the Treaty begun with Forraign Eſtates, and conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates what his Predeceſſours had left imperfect. But <hi>Arnaud,</hi> Governour of <hi>Fort-Lewis,</hi> dying, and <hi>Toiras</hi> ſucceeding him in his commands, favoured by the Cardinal, and <hi>Schomberg,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives greater hopes of ruining <hi>Rochelle,</hi> than ever <hi>Arnaud</hi> did; which were ſo earneſtly embraced, as if they had not at the ſame time undertaken a War againſt the King of <hi>Spaine;</hi> So that the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> ſadly reflecting upon the encreaſe of their perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that the preparations to block them up by Sea were near perfected, and that the Forraign Engagements, nothing leſſened the contrivances againſt their Town, apply themſelves to the Dukes of <hi>Rohan</hi> and <hi>Soubize</hi> for their advice, and aſſiſtance; who were perplexed with many doubts about it, by reaſon of the diviſions, and other defections they had experimented in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Wars, and that they were fearful of diſpleaſing the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Hollanders,</hi> becauſe of the League lately made by them with the King, conceiving that from them they were to expect either their preſervation, or their ruine: Nevertheleſs the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of the <hi>Rochellers</hi> forced them upon a deſign, which the Duke of <hi>Soubize</hi> undertook the management of on <hi>Blavet,</hi> and the ſhips that were there preparing for the Siege of <hi>Rochelle,</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that upon his ſucceſs in the Attempt, the Allies, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates of <hi>France,</hi> would more eaſily incline the King to an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation with the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> as well for the difficulties would obſtruct the purſuit of his intentions againſt them, by reaſon of the loſſe of the Ships deſtined to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as alſo for his deſires to continue the grand deſign of the League.</p>
               <p>Upon this ground the Duke of <hi>Soubize</hi> about the latter end of the yeare departs from <hi>Castres</hi> to go into <hi>Poictou,</hi> where very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly he makes ready five ſmall Veſſels; with which, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the perfidiouſneſs of <hi>Nouailles</hi> to whom he had intruſted
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170346:54"/>
the knowledge of the whole deſign, and who a little before it was ready for execution had diſcovered it; he reſolved either to carry the Fort, or periſh in the attempt. In the beginning of the year 1625, he ſets ſaile from the Iſle of <hi>Ré,</hi> with three hundred Souldiers, and an hundred Mariners, which gave the great Ship called the <hi>Virgin</hi> ſo brave a charge, that after ſome reſiſtance, he himſelf boorded her the third man, with his ſword in his hand, took her, and, preſently after, all the reſt.</p>
               <p>After this he lands his Men, with a reſolution to attempt the Fort, which upon <hi>Noüailles</hi> information, was newly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforced with fifteen or ſixteen piece of Canon, and a ſtronger Gariſon.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Vendoſme</hi> who was Governour of the Province, and had made great preparations to block up the Duke of <hi>Soubize</hi> in the Port of <hi>Blavet,</hi> preſently rallies up two thouſand Foot, and two hundred Gentlemen, to force him in the Port, and with an Iron Chaine, and a Cable, as big as a mans thigh, ſtops the mouth of it, which was very narrow and cloſe adjoyning to the Fort; So that <hi>Soubize</hi> for three whole weeks was locked up in it, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing to guard his ſhips, and man the Town of <hi>Blavet</hi> (whoſe advenue, which was very ſtraight, he had cut off) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, but the above-ſaid number of three hundred Souldiers; and was reduced to ſuch an extremity, that the day before he got off, his great Ship called the <hi>Virgin,</hi> endured a battery of ſix pieces of Canon, and received an hundred and fifty ſhot.</p>
               <p>Whiles he lay in this perillous condition, the wind, that had been, till then, ſtill againſt him, changed, and <hi>Soubize</hi> ſeizing the opportunity, ſent ſome <hi>Shalloupes</hi> mann'd with good reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Souldiers, who, though all the while expoſed to the fury of two thouſand Muſquet ſhot, with Hatchets cut aſunder the chain, and the Cable, that barred the Port; By this means he got out with fifteen or ſixteen ſhips, and loſt but only two which were run aground on the Sands: In this Equipage he recovered the Iſle of <hi>Ré,</hi> where having mended his ſhips, and gotten together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout fifteen hundred men, he ſeizes on the Neighbouring Iſle of <hi>Oleron,</hi> where he ſtaid to compleat his Army.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> at the ſame time, had alſo made way for ſome attempts in <hi>Guienne, Languedoc,</hi> and <hi>Dauphine:</hi> But the Secretary <hi>Montbrun,</hi> as he was travelling with ſome over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures from the Duke to his friends, was taken at <hi>Ville<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neufve</hi> neare <hi>Avignon,</hi> and diſcovered all, which daſhed the greateſt part of his deſigns, and cauſed the three ſons of <hi>Montbrun</hi> to retire to <hi>Anduze.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:170346:54"/>
               <p>Preſently was the news ſpread abroad, that <hi>Soubize</hi> his project was diſcovered, and broken; and the long time he was ſhut up in the Port of <hi>Blavet,</hi> greatly perplexed the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> who had no other news of him, than what the common rumour brought, but ſaw him diſowned by the Town of <hi>Rochelle,</hi> by the Deputies general alſo, and by all the perſons of quality, that were of the Religion, at <hi>Paris,</hi> who more favouring the Court faction, endeavour'd to make all our Towns diſclaim him.</p>
               <p>During this interval nothing was attempted: The two El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of <hi>Montbrun</hi>'s ſonnes, diſcouraged at theſe unhappy begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, make their peace, renounced the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> and go into <hi>Dauphine,</hi> but the youngeſt named <hi>Saint Andre</hi> the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute of them, came to <hi>Castres,</hi> and did what he could, though in vain, to encourage, and retain his Brothers in the Party.</p>
               <p>The Chamber at <hi>Beziers,</hi> and the Preſidial of <hi>Niſmes</hi> alſo, together with all Officers of our Towns, make goodly Acts of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avowal, which they ſent to the Court: But at length when the news came of <hi>Soubize</hi>'s gallant and fortunate Sally out of the Port of <hi>Blavet,</hi> and that he was abſolute Maſter of the Sea, they began to think otherwiſe of him, than as of a Pyrate; and the Baron <hi>Pujols</hi> was ſent from <hi>Paris</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Revillas</hi> from the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and after them came the Baron of <hi>Coupet</hi> alſo from the Conſtable, to mediate an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, to which the Duke was really enclined, and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did what lay in him to promote it, out of a deſire he had to ſerve the King in his Wars in <hi>Italy:</hi> But either the perpetual and malicious contrivances at Court, againſt thoſe of the Religion, or the bad Inſtruments employed in the Treaty, or the indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at that time, of the late King of <hi>England,</hi> and late Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> to aſſiſt us, or all theſe things together, fruſtrated the negotiation of the ſucceſs it might have otherwiſe had, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed ſo with our Towns to make them diſclaime the Duke of <hi>Soubize,</hi> that the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> who till then would not ſtir, was now enforced to take up arms, to ſhew, that it was no defect of power, (as they imagined) but his zeal to pacifie and compoſe things, that had hitherto reſtrained him.</p>
               <p>The firſt day of <hi>May</hi> he began with an attempt upon <hi>Lavaur,</hi> but coming an hour too late, he miſſed of his aimes there: yet was not this expedition wholly ſucceſſeleſs, for in it he wrought all the Towns of <hi>Lauraguais</hi> to declare for him; and at his return to <hi>Castres,</hi> he found, that according to his order, the Marqueſs of <hi>Malanze</hi> was turned out of <hi>Realmont,</hi> which about a month be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had poſſeſſed himſelf of: And here it is to be obſerved,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:170346:55"/>
that <hi>Malauze</hi> was ſought after, as far as <hi>Auvergne,</hi> to be made Head of a party againſt the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> for that the Town of <hi>Rochelle</hi> was divided, and the Common Council refuſed to joyn with <hi>Soubize:</hi> So that the Deputy of the Town, in all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations, ſpoke only as from the common people, which party, the Magiſtrates, and Principal Inhabitants, ſtill oppoſed: So that a very hard task had the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> to reconcile, and unite the Town of <hi>Rochelle,</hi> and the other Corporations of the Religion, with <hi>Soubize.</hi> And foraſmuch as it was very requiſite he ſhould go to bring about the <hi>Sevenes,</hi> and the lower <hi>Languedoc,</hi> where the Deputy of <hi>Rochell</hi> could not have audience; he convequed an Aſſembly of the higher <hi>Languedoc</hi> at <hi>Castres,</hi> by which being choſen for their General, he raiſed ſome Troops, eſtabliſhed a Committee of the Aſſembly to order all affairs in his abſence, and then ſent <hi>Saint Andre de Montbrun</hi> with a Commiſſion to be Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Montauban,</hi> which after much reluctancy, at length de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared alſo for the party.</p>
               <p>This done, he goes thence with ſix hundred Foot, fifty Horſe, and four ſcore <hi>Harquebuſiers,</hi> and marches towards <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laud:</hi> When he came to <hi>Saint Afrique,</hi> he was met by <hi>Couvrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> ſent from the Town of <hi>Rochelle,</hi> and <hi>Soubize,</hi> to inform him of the entire conjunction of the whole Town with <hi>Soubize,</hi> and that, according to the Articles of Agreement, they had ſent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties to the Court, deſiring us to do the like, and to this end <hi>La Faye Saint Orſe</hi> had brought the King's paſs-ports for the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Corporations; to which his Majeſty was at length induced, after he had in vain eſſayed to divide the Dukes of <hi>Rohan</hi> and <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bize,</hi> and bring them to ſeveral Treaties.</p>

Hither came to him three Deputies from <hi>Vigan,</hi> to diſſwade him from marching thither, for that he would finde the Gates ſhut againſt him; to whom he gave no other anſwer, but that he would try whether he ſhould or not: The next day he continues his way, and two Leagues from <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,</hi> met another meſſenger to the ſame purpoſe, who alſo added, in caſe he advanced, threatnings of effuſion of blood: But this prevailing nothing on him, his adverſaries courage failed them, and they drew back; So that without any difficulty he got to <hi>Vigan;</hi> whoſe gates thus opened, cleared all the way as farre as <hi>Anduze.</hi>

               <p>Whiles he was on his march, the Preſidial of <hi>Niſmes,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Chamber of <hi>Beziers,</hi> uſed all their skill (but to no end) to alienate the affections of the people of the <hi>Sevenes</hi> from the Duke; who having reſolved on a journey to <hi>Niſmes,</hi> was yet loth to put it to a hazard, without firſt ſounding the inclinations of the Inhabitants, for fear leſt ſo publick an affront, as a refuſal to his face, ſhould ruine his whole affairs. To this end he ſent thither <hi>Saint Blancart,</hi> who having conference with ſome of his friends in the Suburbs, their advice was, that the Duke ſhould ſuſpend his coming thither, and that they would ſend their Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties alſo to the Court, that the Town of <hi>Uſez</hi> ſhould do the like, with inſtructions conformable to thoſe of the <hi>Sevenes;</hi> which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly they performed, chooſing <hi>Caſtanet</hi> for <hi>Niſmes,</hi> and <hi>Vigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Goudin,</hi> and <hi>Boiſleau,</hi> for <hi>Uſez.</hi>

               <p>The Dake of <hi>Rohan</hi> ſeeing, that he was excluded out of the Towns of <hi>Niſmes, Uſez,</hi> and <hi>Alez,</hi> convoques an Aſſembly of the <hi>Sevenes,</hi> at <hi>Anduze,</hi> the moſt numerous he could, where yet there were many wanting, from many of the Churches, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the <hi>Colloque</hi> of <hi>Saint Germaine,</hi> where the Marqueſs <hi>des Portes</hi> mainly oppoſed him; and after he was declared General of that Country, he ſent <hi>Caillou, Du Cros, Puyredon,</hi> and <hi>Pageſy,</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties to the Court.</p>
               <p>While theſe things were in agitation, the Marſhal <hi>Theminns</hi> brought four thouſand Foot, ſix hundred Horſe, and Canon too, and with them a great terrour alſo upon the Countries of <hi>Laura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guais,</hi> and <hi>Albigeois;</hi> whereof the Duke being advertiſed by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled meſſages, he ſends back the Marqueſs of <hi>Luſignan,</hi> with all the Forces he had brought with him, and with all diligence haſtens his levies of Souldiers, to be commanded by <hi>Freton,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:170346:56"/>
Saint Blancart,</hi> and <hi>Valeſcure,</hi> in which his endeavours met with ſuch unhappy traverſes, that inſtead of four thouſand men, which was the number he aimed at, he could muſter but half the number: Whiles theſe men were raiſing, he ſent his Scouts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Sommieres,</hi> reſolving to attempt it with ſeven or eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred common Souldiers, upon this ſuppoſition, that <hi>Valance</hi> would not run the hazard of drawing out of his Gariſon, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, that it would be a means to make <hi>Niſmes</hi> publickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare for him; and that if he could have but twice four and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty houres time, the whole Countrey would come in to him, and raiſe him to a condition able to force the Caſtle: But, as it is a danugeros thing to prefume on the defects of others, inſtead of relying on a mans own ſtrength, the event clearly deluded his preconceptions; For though he had taken the Town, <hi>Niſmes</hi> would not ſtirre to his aſſiſtance, nor could he get relief from the <hi>Sevenes</hi> time enough; <hi>Valence</hi> at the ſame time ſent twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men, out of his Gariſon, to relieve the Caſtle, who from three of the Clock in the afternoon, till night, fought with <hi>Saint Blancart,</hi> who had lodged himſelf, with three hundred men on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in a place of ſuch advantage, that he could be no way for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, nor yet could he hinder the entry of the relief into the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, by reaſon of the extream largneſs of the advenue: Which the Duke perceiving called off <hi>Saint Blancart</hi> into the Town; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving, that night, to draw off with the whole party alſo, which he did, carrying with him his wounded men; and among others <hi>Freton,</hi> who was wounded with a Muſquet ſhot in the knee, of which he afterwards dyed: <hi>Saint Blancart</hi> in this conflict, when the relief enter'd the Caſtle, loſt three Captaines, and ſome other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers.</p>
               <p>After this, the Duke thought on nothing more, than haſtning his Levies, that he might be in a condition to relieve the higher <hi>Languedoc;</hi> and taking order that his affairs in the <hi>Sevenes</hi> might not be prejudiced in his abſence; to prevent which, he left a Committee of the Aſſembly, to direct the management of them; in which he engaged all that had any intereſt in the places of greateſt conſequence, and left <hi>Chavagnac</hi> his Field Marſhal to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all the Souldiery in that Countrey.</p>
               <p>While theſe things were in agitation in the <hi>Sevenes,</hi> and the lower <hi>Languedoc,</hi> the Marſhal <hi>Themines</hi> drew near to <hi>Castres</hi> to plunder, and ſpoyle the Countrey, which put the Council the Duke had left there, in ſuch a confuſion and feare, that they durſt not give order for any thing at all, but left the whole bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then upon the Dutcheſs of <hi>Rohan,</hi> who contrary to the natural and more tender diſpoſition of her Sex, ſhewed ſo much care

and reſolution in all things, that, every one deriving courage from her example, the Marſhal received ſeveral loſſes, being wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in every skirmiſh before the Town; where <hi>Nougarede</hi> an old Gentleman of the Country got much honour.</p>
               <p>In the mean while the Marqueſs of <hi>Luſignan</hi> marches towards <hi>Caſtres,</hi> with thoſe Forces the Duke had given him to conduct thither; which when the Marſhal had intelligence of, he drew off his Cavalry, and part of his Infantry, to fight him; whom he found lodged in <hi>Croiſette,</hi> a Village two Leagues diſtant from <hi>Caſtres,</hi> where he ſtormed him, but found him ſo well Barrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do'd, and reſolute upon his defence, that after a furious aſſault, he was faine to retire with much loſs, many of his men being ſlain and wounded; which when he had done, the Marqueſs of <hi>Luſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan</hi> retreated as farre as <hi>Braſſac,</hi> and the next day, taking ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, marched with all his Troops into <hi>Caſtres,</hi> at noon day, Drums beating, and Colours flying, and without any oppoſition at all. This renfort, with ſome skirmiſhes that paſſed to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal's diſadvantage, made him, ſeeing he could do no further miſchief to the Town, reſolve to retire to <hi>Saint Paul,</hi> and <hi>la Miatte,</hi> which were ſufficiently manned: Nevertheleſs <hi>Saint Paul</hi> made no reſiſtance at all, but was taken in the open day with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any battery raiſed, or ſiege formed, and the Souldiers all march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off to <hi>La Miatte,</hi> which they yielded alſo upon compoſition not to bear arms for ſix months.</p>
               <p>This was the only check the Marſhal <hi>Themines,</hi> by chance, gave us in <hi>Lauraguais,</hi> and <hi>Albigeois,</hi> where, when he had fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the aforeſaid places, he made as if he would beſiege <hi>Real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont.</hi> But underſtanding that the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> was come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with above two thouſand men, which he brought from the <hi>Sevenes,</hi> whoſe paſſage at <hi>Larſac,</hi> where he had defigned to fight him, ſince he could not prevent; he draws off all his horſe and foot, marches up almoſt to <hi>Castres,</hi> firing all as he went, paſſes by <hi>Braſſac,</hi> endeavouring to gain a commodious field for his Cavalry, between <hi>Cauve</hi> and <hi>Viane:</hi> But <hi>Rohan,</hi> having intelligence of it, makes ſuch haſte, that by inceſſant marches night and day, he got to <hi>Viane,</hi> before the other could be on his way thither; from whence he ſent the Regiment of <hi>Valeſcure</hi> to <hi>Cauve,</hi> and his own guards, and the Captain <hi>Dupuy</hi> with his Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines (for that his foot, was ſo tired they could not march) to <hi>Braſſac.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Marſhal having now loſt all hopes of preventing the Duke, and taking <hi>Braſſac,</hi> goes forward, burning ſome Villages in his march, and comes with his whole ſtrength, both of Horſe, and Foot, in ſight of <hi>Viane,</hi> where having drawn them up in Battai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:170346:57"/>
and ſeeing that the Suburbs of <hi>Viane,</hi> called <hi>Peireſegade,</hi> which lies at the bottome of the Town, and is divided from it, by the height of the hill, was not at all fortified, falls into it with all his Forces, takes, and fires it, and then retires to his Quarters: In this aſſault there was one Captain ſlain, another taken, and about five and twenty, or thirty Souldiers killed and wounded, <hi>Saint Blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cart</hi> alſo had a light hurt; and the ſouldiers that were in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs drew up to the Town.</p>
               <p>The Dutcheſs of <hi>Rohan,</hi> who by ſeveral meſſengers had ſent to informe the Duke, of the Marſhal's deſign to ſtop his paſſage, omits nothing on her part, but ſends to all the Gariſons, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them a Rendezvouz at <hi>Braſſac;</hi> which the Duke having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, he departs that evening, and comes to <hi>Braſſac;</hi> where finding fifteen hundred Foot, and two hundred Horſe; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves, the next night to ſend out to diſcover the poſture of the Marſhal's Army, which lay at <hi>Esperance</hi> between <hi>Braſſac</hi> and <hi>Viane,</hi> and according to the intelligence he ſhould receive to fall into his Quarters the night following, with all his Troops, <hi>Saint Blancart</hi> by the way of <hi>Viane,</hi> and he himſelf by the way of <hi>Braſſac.</hi> The diſcovery made, and the Scouts returning with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligeace that the Army lay there in great diſorder, and in a place of great diſadvantage to the Horſe, the deſign to beat it up was concluded on; but the very day preceding the night it was to be put in execution, either upon notice given him, or that he foreſaw their intentions, or that proviſions failed him, he quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thoſe Quarters, and taking his way towards <hi>Vabres,</hi> went to lodge at <hi>La Bichenie:</hi> The Duke alſo rallyes all his Forces, and marches towards <hi>Croiſette,</hi> and <hi>Roque-courbe,</hi> from whence he ſent five or ſix hundred men into <hi>Realmont,</hi> and then divides all his Troops about <hi>Caſtres,</hi> to obſerve the poſture of the enemy, who when they had refreſhed themſelves for ſome dayes about <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree,</hi> march towards <hi>Lavaure,</hi> and there prepare for a march into <hi>Foix:</hi> The Duke goes into <hi>Lauraguais,</hi> puts ſome men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Britefle,</hi> ſends the Regiment of <hi>Freton</hi> to <hi>Revel</hi> and <hi>Sourire,</hi> and that of <hi>Montiuz</hi> and <hi>Valeſcure,</hi> to <hi>Realmont,</hi> and as ſoon as he ſaw that the enemy ſteered his courſe towards <hi>Foix,</hi> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Saint Blancart,</hi> who was then at <hi>Puylaurens,</hi> thither with five hundred choſen men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Luſignan,</hi> in the mean time, being informed that the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Leſcure</hi> had taken up their Quarters in the Suburbs of <hi>Teillet,</hi> goes inſtantly to beat them up; breaks through their Barricado's, kills, and wounds about an hundred, takes one Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and forces the reſt to flie for ſhelter to the Fort; but had he come by night, as he did by day, not one of them had eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped;
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:170346:57"/>
for there was a very great diſſention between <hi>Grandval,</hi> who commanded the Fort, and <hi>Leſcure,</hi> to whom he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have opened his Gates in the night time; which was the reaſon that induced <hi>Luſignan</hi> to this attempt, in which <hi>Valeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,</hi> and <hi>Montluz,</hi> two Colonels were wounded, but not much: After this the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> returns to <hi>Castres,</hi> whither he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands <hi>Luſignan</hi> alſo; rallies what Forces he had, takes with him one piece of Canon, and Marches towards <hi>Realmont,</hi> both to give the enemy a diverſion, and to enrich his Army with Booty.</p>
               <p>The firſt place he fell upon was <hi>Sicurac,</hi> which endured five and twenty, or thirty Canon ſhot, but after he had fired the Town through the breach, they were faine to yield. This march of his made the whole Countrey look about them; The Duke of <hi>Ventadour</hi> got together about two hundred Horſe, and two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot; The Marſhal <hi>Themines</hi> alſo hies thither, with all his Horſe, and the Regiment of <hi>Normandy;</hi> but both the one, and the other, being informed that the place was taken, went back again; and the Duke continues his courſe towards the Mountain of <hi>Albigeois</hi> and <hi>Roüergue,</hi> leaving his great Canon at <hi>Realmont,</hi> and taking with him only two little field pieces, that carried a Ball about the bigneſs of an Orange.</p>
               <p>Thoſe of <hi>Foix</hi> in the interim, ſent him word, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Caumont, Lesbordes, Samarac,</hi> and <hi>Camerade,</hi> were reſolved to fire their own Towns, and retire, the former to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeres,</hi> the other to <hi>Azil,</hi> for that they wanted Souldiers to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them; whereupon the Duke commanded thither <hi>Boiſſiere</hi> Lieutenant Colonel of <hi>Freton</hi>'s Regiment, with five hundred men, many of whom, when they heard they were to go to <hi>Foix,</hi> forſook their colours, ſo that he went with two hundred and forty only, who got very well thither.</p>
               <p>And here we may not paſs over in ſilence a generous action of ſeven Souldiers of <hi>Foix,</hi> who reſolved, in a poor mudd walled houſe called <hi>Chambonnet</hi> near <hi>Carlat,</hi> to wait for the Marſhal <hi>Themines,</hi> and his whole Army, whom they there kept at a Bay two whole dayes; and after they had, in ſeveral aſſaults, killed forty of his men, ſeeing their ammunition was ſpent, and that he was drawing down his Canon upon them; they conſulted how they might, the night following ſave themſelves; to which end one of them goes out to diſcover how they might avoid the Courts of Guard; which when he had done, and as he was returning, the Centinel of the Houſe eſpying him, and taking him for one of the Enemy, ſhot at him, and broke one of his Thighs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But to return to the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> who marches along the frontires of <hi>Roüergue,</hi> and takes a ſmall Fort called <hi>Roque Ciziere,</hi> in which he left a Garriſon; the ſame day he goes to another, called <hi>La Baſtide,</hi> which he found deſerted, as alſo ſome others which were pillaged, and burnt: From thence he goes to <hi>la Cauve,</hi> and in his way thence towards <hi>Augle,</hi> takes and burns ſome other ſmall Forts; and then makes a deſcent into the Valley of <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel,</hi> where he goes on firing more Forts, up as far as Saint <hi>Pons:</hi> And as he would have continued this progreſſe, in revenge of thoſe places the Marſhal of <hi>Themines</hi> had fired in his abſence; he received intelligence from <hi>Bretigny,</hi> Governour of <hi>Foix,</hi> and from <hi>Saint Blancart</hi> alſo; that the Marſhal <hi>Themines,</hi> and the Count <hi>de Carmain,</hi> Governour of the Province, had inveſted <hi>Azil,</hi> with an Army of ſeven thouſand foot, ſix hundred horſe, and nine peece of Canon; that there were in it ſeven hundred ſouldiers, people of the ſame Countrey, which they had ſent thither, under the command of Captain <hi>Carboust,</hi> and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Vallette,</hi> both experienced old ſouldiers; that they could not conjecture, what would be the iſſue of the Siege, for that the place was but weak, and the aſſaults moſt furious; but yet was it of that conſequence, that if it ſhould miſcarry with thoſe which were in it, there would not be men enough left to maintain the lower <hi>Foix,</hi> both by reaſon of the weakneſſe of <hi>Pamiers,</hi> which would require a very ſtrong Garriſon, and alſo of the Intelligences the enemy had in it: But if he could ſpare them a recruit but of five hundred Men, they would engage themſelves to keep the lower <hi>Foix,</hi> and would do their uttermoſt to preſerve <hi>Azil.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:170346:58"/>
               <p>This Intelligence diverted the Dukes reſolutions, who thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſent <hi>Luſignan</hi> with a party of Horſe and Foot, to convoy the Canon back to <hi>Caſtres,</hi> and thence to <hi>Realmont,</hi> while he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the reſidue of his Troops, with much difficulty convoys ſix hundred Souldiers to <hi>Revel,</hi> where when they had ſtaid a day to receive ſome pay, he ſent them under the command of <hi>Valeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure</hi> into <hi>Foix,</hi> who conducted them very well thither; and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to <hi>Castres.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The difference between the Baron <hi>de Leran,</hi> and <hi>Bretigny,</hi> much perplexed the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> for that, being Maſter of <hi>Carlat</hi> (which was but a League diſtant from <hi>Azil</hi>) it was in his power either to promote, or impede its relief<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whereupon he ſent <hi>Villemore</hi> and <hi>Oroſe,</hi> Captains of his guards, to make him ſenſible of the injury he did himſelf, in obſtructing the relief of <hi>Azil,</hi> by denying his Souldiers admittance into <hi>Carlat,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them withal, in caſe the Baron would not ſubmit to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, publickly to declare to the people of <hi>Carlat</hi> the cauſe of their coming; which they ſo handſomely ordered, that he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by the Inhabitants to yield to the Duke's commands, and to receive whatever Souldiers ſhould at any time be ſent thither, by his order, which proved no ſmall advantage to <hi>Azil,</hi> and indeed was the only cauſe of its preſervation.</p>
               <p>While things were thus carried on in <hi>Foix,</hi> the Duke <hi>d' E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spernon,</hi> with fifteen hundred Horſe, and four thouſand Foot, advances towards <hi>Montauban</hi> to ravage the Countrey therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts; and <hi>Soubize,</hi> to divert him, makes a deſcent into <hi>Medoc,</hi> where he took ſome Gariſons: But underſtanding that <hi>Manti,</hi> with the Admiral of <hi>Zealand,</hi> named <hi>Haultin,</hi> were coming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him with forty good Ships of War, he re-imbarques, meets, fights, and defeats them, ſinks five of their Ships, of which the Vice-Admiral of <hi>Zealand</hi> was one, and kills them more than fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men.</p>
               <p>The news of this defeat, made them change their note at Court, and whereas before they protracted the Treaty in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of the iſſue of this fight, now, ſeeing it proved to their diſadvantage, they conclude it, and ſend Deputies to the <hi>Rochel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,</hi> to receive their acceptance of it: <hi>Forain</hi> alſo goes to them from the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> who, conſidering the indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the King of <hi>England,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> towards their party, adviſed them to accept of that peace their Naval Victory had purchaſed them; to which <hi>Soubize</hi> adds his perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons alſo; but the <hi>Rochellers</hi> very indiſcreet in that particular, and according to the humour of people as inſolent in proſperity, as deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in adverſity, refufe to hearken to it, without a preſent demoliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Fort.</p>

               <p>In the mean time the King takes great care ſpeedily to repair his Fleet, and obtains of the King of <hi>England</hi> ſeven great Ships; So that the delayes the <hi>Rochellers</hi> uſed in concluding the Treaty of peace, gave their enemies opportunity to corrupt ſome of the Captains of <hi>Soubize</hi> his Fleet, and among others, his Vice-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral <hi>Fozan:</hi> At the ſame time alſo the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> reſolves upon a deſcent into the Iſle of <hi>Ré,</hi> and to make an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon <hi>Soubize</hi> his Fleet which lay in the <hi>Foſs de l' Oye,</hi> a Road joyning to the Town of <hi>Saint Martin de Ré;</hi> a raſh and ſenſeleſs enterprize in appearance, which yet treachery made feiſible, and purchaſed it a far different Character.</p>
               <p>Then came <hi>Milletiere</hi> and <hi>Madiane</hi> to <hi>Rochelle,</hi> with the Articles of peace agreed on at <hi>Fontainbleau;</hi> but it was then, when <hi>Soubize,</hi> who was in the Iſle of <hi>Ré,</hi> ſent them word thence, that the King's Navy were ſayling towards him, and that with all ſpeed they ſhould tranſport themſelves into the Iſland: At firſt, every one laughed at this Meſſage, nay, and there were ſome in <hi>Rochelle</hi> offered to lay great wagers, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships were called off again: <hi>Soubize</hi> reiterates his Meſſages, and for the laſt time ſummons them to his aſſiſtance: There were then in <hi>Rochelle</hi> eight hundred Gentlemen well moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and about eight or nine hundred Souldiers, of <hi>Soubize</hi> his Army, with the greateſt part of his Officers, and among others the Counts of <hi>Laval,</hi> and <hi>Loudriere:</hi> Upon this laſt ſummons they all make ready to imbarque; but the Maior diverted them, perſwading them that they were better to expect the morning, than run the hazard of the evening Tide, and ſo made them loſe all opportunity to tranſport themſelves; For the next morning appeared thirteen of the King's great Ships in the Road, which prevented their paſſage over: <hi>Soubize</hi> ſeeing himſelf thus aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, lands all his Foot, which were not above fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Souldiers, leaving only an hundred in his great ſhip called the <hi>Virgin;</hi> commands his Admiral <hi>Guiton,</hi> and his Vice-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral <hi>Fozan,</hi> not to ſtirre out of the Road, where they were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, but there to wait his further Orders; And then divides his Army into three Squadrons, to ſecure thoſe three places, which he conceived moſt obnoxious to danger, and where he thought it moſt probable that the enemies ſhould attempt to land: But, notwithſtanding all his care, he could not diſpatch time enough, before <hi>Toiras</hi> had landed three thouſand Foot, and fifteen hundred Horſe; whereupon he reſolved to draw all his men into a body, and fight him the next day, which accordingly he did: At the firſt onſet he routed the Avantguard, and ſlew about three or foureſcore of the moſt forward of them; but being relieved by

the main body, <hi>Bellesbat</hi> who commanded <hi>Soubize</hi> his left wing, inſtead of ſeconding him, faced about, and plunged himſelf, and the whole party he commanded in the Marſhes: This much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged the Enemy, who now oppreſſed <hi>Soubize</hi> on all ſides, whoſe Major General <hi>Verger-Malague,</hi> and ſome of his Captains being ſlain, the reſt fled in ſuch confuſion, that all the Art and Induſtry of <hi>Soubize</hi> could not rally them againe; who yet that day, even by the confeſſion of his enemies, juſtly purchaſed the reputation of a worthy Commander, and valiant Souldier. The remainder of his Troops he drew off to <hi>Saint Martin de Ré,</hi> where he made account to tranſport them againe to his ſhips, and once more try his Fortune in a battaile at Sea; But there he found, ſo great a terrour had poſſeſſed <hi>Guiton,</hi> that contrary to his expreſs command, he had turned out the hundred Souldiers left in the <hi>Virgin;</hi> and that <hi>Fozan,</hi> with ſome Captains, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined in the ſame conſpiracy with him, to intimidate the reſt, had runne aground the beſt ſhips, and that the reſt, ſeeing themſelves thus betrayed, and abandoned, ſhifted every one, the beſt he could, for himſelf; all but the <hi>Virgin,</hi> in which there were only five Men left, but very reſolute, who ſeeing four of the King's ſhips making towards them, reſolved to ſtand it out againſt all extremities: The enemy came up to, grappled with, and boorded them, whereupon the Maſter, whoſe name was <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand,</hi> leaps into the powder with a lighted match, and blows up all the five Ships together, in which there periſhed ſeven hundred thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſix men.</p>
               <p>In this accident there was one thing very remarkable, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning one <hi>Chaligny</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Poictou,</hi> and his ſon, who were two of the five left in the Ship: The father, before the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Magazine, being wounded, and diſabled to ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by ſwimming, commanded his ſon to ſhift for himſelf, who, with much reluctancy, at length obeyed him; but the good man, being in the protection of God, was as well preſerved, as his Sonne; for being, by the force of the Powder, carried up into the aire, he chanced to fall into a Shalloup of the enemies, without receiving any further harm at all, and was afterwards ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Soubize</hi> finding his affairs in ſo broken a condition, leaves his Major General <hi>Le Parc d' Archiat,</hi> at <hi>Saint Martin d' Ré,</hi> and in a Shalloup gets to the Iſle of <hi>Oleron,</hi> where he provides the beſt he could for the preſervation of it, leaving five hundred men in the Fort, which he furniſhed with all neceſſaries, and then, with ſeven of his ſhips, which had retired thither, ſets out to ſea, and out of the reliques of his late Fleet, gets together
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:170346:60"/>
two and twenty Ships, with which he paſſes into <hi>England</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair them: After which, <hi>Le Parc d' Archiat,</hi> made an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable compoſition, which was alſo well obſerved, and drew off all his men from the Iſle of <hi>Ré</hi> to <hi>Rochelle;</hi> But thoſe that <hi>Soubize</hi> left in the Iſle of <hi>Oleron</hi> yielded themſelves baſely, a thing not unuſual after ſuch routs; for it is not given to all men, to have their courages of an equal temper in adverſity and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity.</p>
               <p>This fatal accident did not ſo much deject the ſpirits of the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> as it elevated theirs at Court: For when <hi>Milletiere</hi> and <hi>Madiane,</hi> returned thither with the <hi>Rochellers</hi> acceptance of the peace, they would not endure any further mention of it; but to break them by a diviſion, continued their old project of gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a peace to the higher and lower <hi>Languedoc,</hi> excluding <hi>Rochelle,</hi> and <hi>Soubize.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>While theſe things thus paſſed in thoſe parts, they of <hi>Azil</hi> held out beyond the expectation of their friends, and the hopes of their enemies that beſieged them, who from a battery of Nine Guns ſent them in three thouſand ſhot, and made three indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent large breaches: But the enemy preparing to give them a general, and furious ſtorme, <hi>Bretigny,</hi> and <hi>Saint Blancart,</hi> who had ſeveral times relieved them, reſolved, now at this laſt puſh, to Rack all their powers for them; The conduct of this relief was undertaken by <hi>Saint Blancart,</hi> who got in to them with three hundred and fifty men, forcing, in his paſſage, a Court of guard which kept a Bridge, with the loſs of one man only: The arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of this renfort ſilenced all diſputes, among the beſieged, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the command, which before had occaſioned ſome divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions among them; but all acknowledging <hi>Saint Blancart</hi> for their Superiour, he ſo well ordered all things, that after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of eighteen hundred Canon Bullets within the ſpace ofthree dayes, the Marſhal <hi>Themines</hi> gave them a fierce aſſault with his whole Army, commanding alſo five hundred Reformado's to diſmount, and ſerve on Foot (there being many hundreds of people that had placed themſelves on the tops of Mountains to behold this fight:) Thrice was he repulſed with the loſs of above five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men; Within the Town the Capta in <hi>Vallette</hi> who comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at one of the breaches was there ſlaine, ſome other Officers too, the beſieged loſt, together with ſeventy or eighty Souldiers ſlaine and wounded: But above all, either friends or enemies, <hi>Saint Blancart</hi> there Renowned himſelf, both by his prudent care and vigilance in repairing the breaches, and his Valour in defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them, being alwayes ready in perſon at all places of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt danger; in this action ſurpaſſing even himſelf: The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:170346:60"/>
now thinks of nothing, but how to draw off his Canon; in which having ſpent two whole nights, and many of his Souldiers, which he loſt in the Attempt; he drew off with the Fragments of his ſhattered Army towards <hi>Laura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guais.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſmall ſucceſs, together with the effect the Duke of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han</hi>'s continual ſollicitations wrought upon the people of <hi>Niſmes,</hi> inducing them to declare for his party, relevated his affairs out of the drooping condition they were in: Some of our Deputies then attending the Court, were about the ſame time ſent to the Communalties to procure their acceptance of the peace, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Rochelle</hi> and <hi>Soubize,</hi> which many ill affected zealouſly promoted, eſpecially at <hi>Caſtres,</hi> where they had reſolved to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to it upon thoſe terms: But <hi>Rohan</hi> arriving there in the nick, and urging their former reſolutions to the contrary, made them alter their intentions, and then ſummoned an Aſſembly at <hi>Millaud,</hi> where the Towns of <hi>Niſmes</hi> and <hi>Uſez</hi> appeared by their Deputies, and all unanimouſly made an Act of acceptance joyntly with <hi>Soubize</hi> and <hi>Rochelle,</hi> and ſent it to the Court.</p>
               <p>The Duke who ſeveral times had experience of their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to ſurprize him, under pretence of Treating, ſtops not there, but goes to <hi>Niſmes,</hi> and <hi>Uſez,</hi> where he was received with great acclamations of joy; and having confirmed his Party in <hi>Aletz,</hi> by ſending thither <hi>Marmeyrac,</hi> a Gentleman of the Country, to head them upon occaſion, departs one night from <hi>Niſmes,</hi> and comes the next morning, by ten of the Clock, to <hi>Aletz,</hi> where at firſt he found the gates ſhut againſt him, but the induſtry and diligence of <hi>Marmeyrac</hi> quickly got them open, ſo that now there was not any place in the lower <hi>Languedoc,</hi> or the <hi>Sevenes,</hi> that had not declared for the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> who convened an Aſſembly of the <hi>Sevenes</hi> at <hi>Aletz,</hi> both to aſſure himſelf of the Town, and alſo of the <hi>Colloque</hi> of <hi>Saint Germain,</hi> which the continual ſollicitations of the Marqueſs <hi>de Portes,</hi> and his faction, had ſtill kept off from him; which obliged the Duke, in the interim, before the meeting of the Aſſembly, to make a ſtep thither, where his preſence was of great uſe, both to procure Deputations for the Aſſembly, and the conjunction of that <hi>Colloque</hi> with the others.</p>
               <p>At the beginning of the Aſſembly the Dutcheſs of <hi>Rohan</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatched <hi>Villette</hi> to the Duke her Husband, with intelligence, that, upon the aſſurance many Communalties had given of their readineſs to accept of the offered peace, with the excluſion of <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bize</hi> and <hi>Rochelle,</hi> the Court party ſtiffely perſiſted in their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer reſolutions, not to admit of any other, and had ſent back
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:170346:61"/>
ſome of their Deputies to declare their adherence to them; and that therefore it would concern him, to have a vigilant eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their actions: This meſſage had a ſiniſter ſence put upon it, and the Marqueſs of <hi>Montbrun,</hi> who a few dayes before came to <hi>Niſmes,</hi> on purpoſe to inſinuate himſelf into the affections of the people, found no better expedient to effect it, than vailing his intentions with a pretence of much zeal to the Religion, by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging ſcandalous accuſations againſt the Duke of <hi>Rohan;</hi> which when he had notice of, and that <hi>Du Cros</hi> was come with the final determination of the Court, not to grant any peace, but with the excluſion of <hi>Soubize,</hi> and <hi>Rochelle;</hi> he took him with him to <hi>Niſmes,</hi> convoqued a ſecond Aſſembly at <hi>Millaud,</hi> and cauſed <hi>Niſmes,</hi> and <hi>Uſez,</hi> in his preſence, to nominate their Deputies, and reſolve in no wiſe to deſert <hi>Soubize</hi> and <hi>Rochelle;</hi> from thence he went to <hi>Vigan,</hi> where he alſo cauſed De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties, of the like reſolution with thoſe of <hi>Niſmes</hi> and <hi>Uſez,</hi> to be choſen for all the <hi>Sevenes;</hi> and with them all proceed together to <hi>Millaud.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>While he was thus buſied about theſe affairs, he receives news of <hi>Soubize</hi> from the Dutcheſs of <hi>Rohan,</hi> which aſſured him, that, within three months, the King of <hi>England</hi> would ſend a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſiderable relief to <hi>Rochelle,</hi> deſired him to make it known to the party, and to order things ſo, that they deſert him not. When he came to <hi>Millaud,</hi> he underſtood that the higher <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc</hi> had determined to accept of the peace, excluding <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bize</hi> and <hi>Rochelle,</hi> and that, had not the preſence of <hi>Luſignan,</hi> and <hi>Saint Blancart,</hi> as they returned from <hi>Foix</hi> with the Troops of the <hi>Sevenes,</hi> very opportunely prevented it, they had ſent their acceptance to the Court. This intelligence made the Duke carry on the Aſſembly as far as <hi>Caſtres,</hi> where when he had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled the Province anew, and received the reſolutions of thoſe of <hi>Montauban,</hi> to the ſame effect with thoſe of the Provinces of the lower <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and the <hi>Sevenes,</hi> he inforced the former to retract their late intentions, and to confirm the other Act of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, including <hi>Soubize</hi> and <hi>Rochelle:</hi> But to effect this, he was obliged to ſome extremities, ſecuring the perſons of ſeven or eight of the moſt eminent Citizens, whom he diſperſed into divers places of <hi>Roüergue,</hi> and the Mountain of <hi>Albigeois;</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing a Declaration of what he had done, as alſo the reaſons moving him thereunto, together with the Decrees of the ſaid Provinces, which were approved by all, except the Town of <hi>Puy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laurens,</hi> who reſolved to ſtand upon their Guards, and not to open their gates to any of either ſide; proteſting notwithſtanding that they wodul not diſ-unite from the party of the Religion.</p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:170346:61"/>
               <p>When their affairs were brought to this paſs, the Deputies were ſent back to the Court with the final determination of the Provinces not to abandon <hi>Rochelle:</hi> And a few dayes after their departure, arrives a Meſſenger from <hi>Vivaretz,</hi> who informed the Duke, that <hi>Briſon</hi> had taken <hi>Pouſin,</hi> and ſome other places of leſs importance, and that all <hi>Vivaretz</hi> had declared for his party, and did beſeech him to advow the taking of thoſe places, and to confer the Government of <hi>Pouſin,</hi> and the whole Province upon <hi>Briſon,</hi> which he condeſcended to.</p>
               <p>Not long after, the Dutcheſs of <hi>Rohan</hi> ſends the Viſcount <hi>Rouſſille</hi> to her husband, with intelligence that the Earle of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and Sir — <hi>Carleton</hi> extraordinary Ambaſſadors from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and <hi>Arſens</hi> extraordinary Ambaſſadour from the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> were arrived at Court to ſollicite the King to ſign the League, and make us accept the peace, which ſhe believed was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready well advanced, and that ſhe deſired, if poſſible, to hear from him before it were concluded; to which the Duke replied by the ſame Meſſenger, that above all things the Deputies ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to preſerve from demolition, the fortifications of <hi>Pouſin;</hi> that that being obtained, and the <hi>Rochellers</hi> contented, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munalties where he was, would reſt very well ſatisfied: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fides the aforeſaid Ambaſſadours, thoſe of <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Savoy,</hi> in ſhort, all that were intereſſed in the League, out of the hopes the King would ſign it, interpoſed their mediation alſo, to haſten the peace; which the Ambaſſadours of <hi>England</hi> by a Deed in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, in the name of the King their Maſter, became ſureties for the entire obſervation of; againſt which the Deputies of the Communalties having nothing to object, the peace was accepted by them, on the fifth day of <hi>February,</hi> eight dayes before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the Viſcount <hi>Rouſſille.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whil'ſt the Duke was buſied in compoſing the diſorders of the higher <hi>Languedoc,</hi> he was alarmed by reiterated meſſages, that <hi>Niſmes,</hi> unleſs his ſudden preſence prevented it, would be certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loſt, by reaſon of the diviſions happened ſince the arrival of the Marqueſs of <hi>Montbrun,</hi> and his brothers there; who with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Artifices, and great diligence, had gained the populacy to them, and by ſeditions, and tumults, attempted to ingroſs the power of the whole Country, which the moſt eminent of the Nobility with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, ſo that the matter was now come to a formal quarrel, which, but by his preſence, was not appeaſable; this made him haſten his inſtructions for the higher <hi>Languedoc,</hi> where he leaves the Marqueſs of <hi>Luſignan,</hi> with four companies of ſtrangers, whom he quartered in <hi>Caſtres,</hi> and then poſts away to <hi>Niſmes;</hi> where at his arrival, he met firſt of all with the Baron <hi>D' Aubais,</hi> whom
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:170346:62"/>
the lower <hi>Languedoc</hi> had deputed to the Court; and afterwards with <hi>Montmartin,</hi> the Deputy General, who brought with them their late acceptation of the peace, and were now come to have it ratified; <hi>Mainald</hi> the other Deputy General, <hi>Du Candal,</hi> and <hi>Mailleray</hi> were ſent to <hi>Rochelle, Novillan</hi> to <hi>Montauban,</hi> and <hi>Madiane</hi> to the higher <hi>Lauguedoc.

                     </gap>s,</hi> but by no means would he conſent to any particular ratification; but ſummoned an Aſſembly to be held at <hi>Niſmes,</hi> in which the Act of acceptance ſhould with a general conſent be confirmed on the fifteenth day of <hi>March</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing; deferring it to a longer term, that he might in the mean time hear from <hi>Rochelle;</hi> in which interval, <hi>Montmartin</hi> goes to the higher <hi>Languedoc,</hi> to haſten the Deputies of that Province to appear at the time appointed: But he found that at <hi>Montauban</hi> the peace was already accepted, and that, without expecting the Convocation, all the higher <hi>Languedoc</hi> had alſo ratified it, ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Deputies thither for forme only. The day before the Seſſion of the Aſſembly, the Duke was informed of the <hi>Rochellers</hi> confirmation of it alſo; ſo that there remaining only the lower <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and the <hi>Sevenes</hi> to do the like, the Aſſembly drew up a general Act of Ratification, which <hi>Montmartin</hi> and <hi>Aubais</hi> with the Deputies of the Duke of <hi>Rohau</hi> carried to the Court; in this act only the Province of <hi>Vivaretz</hi> was not comprized, for that then they muſt ſurrender <hi>Pouſin,</hi> which our Deputies could not preſerve, becauſe they had no Commiſſion to make any demands concerning it before the peace was concluded; which was occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the negligence of the Deputy of that Province, that gave not notice of the taking of <hi>Pouſin,</hi> till many dayes after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of our Deputies towards the Court.</p>
               <p>Thus was our peace concluded, where we muſt obſerve, that the King, out of fear of the ſupplies the Duke of <hi>Soubize</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured in <hi>England,</hi> taking occaſion from, and making very good uſe of the diſcontents of the Engliſh Ambaſſadours, ſent <hi>Botru</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> who ſo well managed all, that during his Embaſſy, which laſted but three weeks, he obtained a <hi>Renvoy</hi> of new Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours thence to <hi>France,</hi> to conclude all things concerning the League, upon condition they ſhould enforce the Deputies of the Religion to accept a peace, upon very ambiguous and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain terms, eſpecially for the Town of <hi>Rochelle;</hi> who, in regard they had no hopes of any conſiderable relief from any other part, were of neceſſity obliged to be ſubmiſſive to them. The Deputies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the particular Provinces, to ſhew that they of the Religion prefer'd the advancement of the grand deſign of the League be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their own ſecurity, and to remove out of the way the pretence
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:170346:62"/>
of the Kings Counſel for not ſigning it, while the War continued in <hi>France,</hi> did the like: But ſo reſolute was the demeanour of the Dutcheſs of <hi>Rohan</hi> towards the Engliſh Ambaſſadours, and the Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> to whom he proteſted, that unleſs the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours interpoſed in it, nothing ſhould be concluded, that, after ſhe had neatly broken a particular Treaty of the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> carried on by their Deputies, whom the Court-party, and the Duke of <hi>Trimoüille</hi> had drawn over to them, ſhe prevailed ſo far upon them all, that contrary to their former reſolutions, they intereſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in it. This ſhelter'd her from the malice of her enemies, and the Deputies from any blame that might be imputed to them from their Communalties, and alſo obliged the King of <hi>England,</hi> ſeeing that the peace was accepted by his advice, to ſee it faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerved, to which his Ambaſſadours more ſtrictly bound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by a formal Deed, ſigned, and ſealed with their own Arms; ſo that the concluſion of our peace was an univerſal joy both to the Court, and all Forraign Ambaſſadours there reſiding; but fifteen dayes after, when contrary to the ſolemn proteſtations made to them concerning that particular, they ſaw alſo this Treaty in the <hi>Valtoline</hi> was concluded by the King, &amp; the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> they were clouded with no leſs diſcontent; eſpecially the Engliſh, when they perceived, that betrayed by deluſory hopes, they had been made the inſtruments, to oblige us to accept a peace ſo much to our diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
               <p>Thus did the French, in couſening the Engliſh, and all the Princes intereſſed in the League, deceive themſelves alſo, having done nothing in this affair, that tended not to the advantage of <hi>Spain,</hi> the oppreſſion of the Allies of the Crown, and the great detriment of <hi>France</hi> it ſelf.</p>
               <p>This is an account of the paſſaget in the ſecond War; in the progreſs of which <hi>Rohan</hi> and <hi>Soubize</hi> were oppoſed by all the Grandees, even of the ſame Religion, whom either too much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, or too little zeal, had aliened from their party, by all the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Crown, and a great part of the moſt eminent of every Town, whom their own covetouſneſs, and the allurements of the Courts had blinded; as for the Forraign Nations, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Hollanders</hi> contributed their Ships, and <hi>Germany</hi> it ſelf ſtood in need of the aſſiſtance of others; ſo that it is no great wonder if a better peace could not be obtained; but yet was it much more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous than the former, foraſmuch as thoſe of the Religion preſerv'd their Fortifications, and got the King of <hi>Englands</hi> caution for the performance of it; God will aſſiſt us more powerfully, when our entire converſion to him makes us more capable of his favour.</p>

               <p>This was the laſt Act of the Conſtable's life, which ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly after the termination of this affaire, crowned with many dayes and much honour, he yielded up at <hi>Valence:</hi> He was a Gentleman of <hi>Dauphine,</hi> who by his valour, prudence, and good fortune, having paſſed through all the leſſer charges of the War, had advanced himſelf to the higheſt: And had not ſo conſtant and uninterrupted a courſe of proſperity, effaced, towards his latter end, all ſhame in him, ſo that, he diſhonoured God, by his domeſtick, and infamous debauches, ſullying his houſe with Adulteries, and publique Inceſts, he might have juſtly been parallel'd with the greateſt Perſons, Antiquity can boaſt of!</p>
               <p>From this amicable compoſure of our Inteſtine differences, ſprung faire hopes of the duration of our peace; which in a ſhort time alſo withered: For it was contrary to the intention of thoſe that aimed to raiſe their fortunes upon the ruines of thoſe of the Religion: Amongſt whom the Marqueſs <hi>de Portes</hi> was the moſt violent, who favoured by the command he had in the lower <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc,</hi> left no way uneffayed to force the people upon ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate courſe; of whom he exacted contributions as in the time of the War, though by the Articles of the Treaty, they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely aboliſhed: But this being not enough to provoke a people harraſſed with ſo many and yet ſmarting miſchiefs, and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous to enjoy the ſmall repoſe they poſſeſſed, they fly to another invention; which was to ground a jealouſie upon the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi>'s ſtay at <hi>Niſmes,</hi> which many, out of a deſire, either to conſerve an old ill paid penſion, or to purchaſe a new one, fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with frequent calumnies, no week paſſing without ſome new accuſations exhibited againſt him, upon which, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility they propoſed to themſelves of expelling him the Town, they reſolve to make him the object of their malice, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering their deſign by an occaſion taken from the annual electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Conſuls for <hi>Niſmes,</hi> who are alwayes choſen at the later end of the year.</p>
               <p>Whiles they ſo induſtriouſly labour his ruine here, they are nothing leſs remiſs to procure it in the other Provinces, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed over all <hi>France,</hi> ſtriking at him by the National Synod, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be held at <hi>Castres</hi> as a place moſt animated againſt the Duke, for that during the laſt War, he had uſed ſome ſeverity towards ſome perſons of quality in that Town, that would have betrayed him. Thither was ſent Commiſſioner <hi>Galand,</hi> a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:170346:64"/>
without contradiction of very great abilities, but withal mercenary, and void of ſhame, or conſcience, with inſtructions to diſapprove the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi>'s late engagement in armes, to diſadvow his forraign Intelligences, and, if poſſible, to get him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated.</p>
               <p>The Duke ſeeing two ſuch ſtrong batteries raiſed againſt him, and threatning more danger than the War it ſelf, prepares to defend himſelf againſt their violence: And foraſmuch as that of the Synod ſeemed to be of greateſt conſequence, he endeavoured to ſecure himſelf againſt it, by procuring, in ſeveral Provinces of <hi>France,</hi> the election of ſuch perſons for Deputies, as were men of an inflexible integrity both to the Party and himſelf too, and draws up a Declaration, remonſtrating chiefly the juſt cauſe he had to uſe ſuch proceedings againſt thoſe he had formerly expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Town; for that he know that to be the principal crime they had to charge him with in the Synod: And foraſmuch as the Town at a publick conſultation had ordered their gates to be kept ſhut againſt him, and that he feared the like uſage from them to any ſhould come from him, he very privately made choice of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Miniſter, in the room of his own Chaplaine, to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate his Declaration to his friends, and to entreat <hi>Beaufort</hi> the Deputy of the <hi>Sevenes</hi> to deliver his Letter, which he had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the Synod, with charge, that neither the one, nor the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould diſcover themſelves, but when it might be very ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable; which happened well to him; for they were prepared to refuſe admittance to any that ſhould come from him; nay, <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> his Chaplain, though he proteſted, that he came only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an affair of particular concernment to himſelf, could not be permitted any longer ſtay there, than of four and twenty houres.</p>
               <p>On the fifteenth of <hi>September,</hi> in the year 1626, <hi>Chauve</hi> was choſen Moderator, <hi>Bouterouë</hi> Aſſiſtant, <hi>Blondel</hi> Paſtor, and <hi>Petit</hi> an Advocate of <hi>Niſmes</hi> Scribe. And now <hi>Galand</hi> beſtirres himſelf againſt the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> whoſe enemies in <hi>Caſtres</hi> are no leſs diligent in preparing the venome they had to poure out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Duke in the Synod, animated alſo thereunto by the Commiſſioner <hi>Galland:</hi> But all their deſignes vaniſhed into air: For the Deputies being before ſufficiently ſatisfied with the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons moving the Duke to proceed againſt them in that manner, made them not dare to preſent any bill againſt him to the Synod; who nevertheleſs could not conceale the diſpleaſure they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived againſt thoſe of <hi>Castres,</hi> with whom they diſclaimed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny future reconciliation; ſo that they were now become a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral abomination; and the only way to ruine any affaire, was to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:170346:65"/>
offer it to <hi>Galand</hi>'s recommendation; And thus ended the Synod, where, by the Kings command, (that he might abridge thoſe of the Religion, of their liberty of convening any Generall Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies) were choſen the Deputies General: The ſix nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, were the Count <hi>de la Suze,</hi> the Marqueſs of <hi>Galerande,</hi> and <hi>Beaufort</hi> for the Nobility: and for the Commonalty, <hi>Texier, Dupuy</hi> Deputy of <hi>Burgogne,</hi> and <hi>Bazin;</hi> of whom <hi>Galerande</hi> and <hi>Bazin</hi> were accepted.</p>
               <p>This affair thus terminated, we muſt now reflect upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulate of <hi>Niſmes.</hi> The Preſidial, or Soveraign Court of the Town, according to the humour of many Corporations, not brooking the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> ſo near them, joyned with a Party compoſed of many perſons of Note in the Town, whom the Court faction had invited, and drawn over to them: But finding themſelves yet too weak, by ordinary and Legal wayes, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote to the Conſulate Creatures of their own, they reſolve to engage the Royal power in it, and to effect it by wayes unuſual and deſtructive to their own Priviledges, and contrary to the Articles of the late Peace. To which end, they ſend privately to the Court, where they obtain a Commiſſion directed to the Chamber of Edict in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> to go and order the ſaid E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the Conſuls; and that nothing might be omitted to forward their deſign, the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> is ſent from the Court into his government, who paſſes by <hi>Niſmes,</hi> where he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages thoſe of his Faction, which he ſtrengthens with the neighbouring Nobility; and thoſe he could not win to his Party, he forces to abſent themſelves from the Town, till the buſineſs was determined: And for as much as the Marqueſs of <hi>Montbrun</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the latter end of the former war, had gained ſome credit among the Populacy, he was alſo ſent for out of <hi>Dauphine;</hi> for they hoped not only to make ſuch Conſuls as ſhould be at their devotion, but upon the Dukes oppoſing himſelf againſt it, to hale him out of the Town, dead or alive: Theſe things thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, the day of Election comes; the Marqueſs of <hi>Montbrun</hi> alſo arrives at the time appointed, ſo do <hi>Monſac, DeSuc,</hi> and the two <hi>Deans</hi> (or Seniour Counſellors) of the Chamber, who were nominated Commiſſioners for this affair; who declaring their charge to the Deputies of the Town, receive for anſwer, their fixed reſolutions, to maintain the Priviledges of the Town: The Common-Council of which meet according to their accuſtomed manner, in the morning to proceed to the ſaid Election; whither the Commiſſioners go alſo; but finding the doors of the Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe ſhut, are fain to return to their lodgings, where they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare againſt the proceedings of the Common-Council, and ſend
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:170346:65"/>
about the Town to aſſemble the Inhabitants for a new Election; ſome refuſe to ſtir, others go, but without any commotion in the Town were obliged to retire again.</p>
               <p>Now the new Conſuls enter not into their Office, till a moneth after the Election; ſo that the Court had leaſure to ſend a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition to thoſe that were elected, forbidding them to meddle with the Office, and enjoyning the old ones to continue the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of it, till it were otherwiſe ordered: notwithſtanding which, when the firſt day of the year was come, the Baron <hi>d' Aubais, Genoyer, Saguter,</hi> and <hi>Peliſſiere,</hi> according to the uſual manner took poſſeſſion of the Conſulate; where we ſhall leave them in repoſe, to look further back upon the affairs, and view their propenſity to new imbroylments.</p>
               <p>When the Peace was concluded in the year 1626, it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that the Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi>'s thoughts would be wholly bent on forraign affairs, of which he gave ſome ſemblant evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: The Prince of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> then at Court, was nominated Leiutenant-General of the Kings Armies for forraign Parts; then hoped the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambaſſadours, they ſhould now ſee <hi>Italy</hi> freed from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> oppreſſion; the <hi>Engliſh</hi> that they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the <hi>Palatinate;</hi> and preparations were making (but in words only) for all theſe deſigns; of the reality of which if any one ſeemed to doubt, it was confirmed by a thouſand oaths: But when a few dayes after the ſigning of the Peace with thoſe of the Religion, unknown to all the Confederates, was ſigned alſo that of <hi>France</hi> with <hi>Spain;</hi> then brake forth complaints and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the one ſide, ſeconded by excuſes of the other, every one caſting the blame upon another, eſpecially upon. <hi>Fargis</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour in <hi>Spain,</hi> whoſe Wife, as if he had exceeded the limits of his Commiſſion, was made to ſue out his Pardon: but theſe pretences could not ſalve the diſtempers of the Confederates in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed in the League, which ſome of them afterwards upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions did diſcover.</p>
               <p>The cauſe of this ſudden and unexpected peace, was attributed to a deſire the Cardinal had to live ſome time in quiet, that he might the better ſecure his own greatneſs. and that nothing might obſtruct his purſuit of the deſign againſt <hi>Rochelle,</hi> where he intended to do great matters; or elſe to ſome Jealouſie he had conceived of a new party, to be raiſed in <hi>France,</hi> under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Duke <hi>Anjou</hi> to ruin him; but whether it was the one, or the other, or both together, certainly the occaſion of theſe enſuing factions, gave him fair colours for any deſign.</p>
               <p>The Queen Mother deſirous to marry the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> would needs conſummate the Match, deſigned by <hi>Henry</hi> the great, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:170346:66"/>
him and the Princeſs of <hi>Montpenſier,</hi> which he was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely averſe from; whether this averſion proceeded from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or the ſuggeſtions of others, not deſirous this treaty ſhould take effect; which encouraged many to joyn with him. But the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> and his Wife, whom this marriage threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with a remove ſo many degrees from the Crown, as the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> ſhould have Sons; The Count of <hi>Soiſſons</hi> for the ſame reaſon, and out of hopes he had to marry that Princeſs himſelf: The Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi> out of Jealouſie of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> whoſe Sons were all Brothers to the Princeſs <hi>Montpenſier;</hi> The Duke of <hi>Vendoſme</hi> upon the ſame conſideration, to which his Brother the Grand Prior of <hi>France</hi> added his diſcontents againſt the Cardinal, who had deluded him with promiſes of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty of <hi>France,</hi> which afterwards under another title, he reſerved to himſelf; many of the chief Nobility out of particular Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts; The Queen who feared the others fertility would preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice her in the King her Husbands and his Subjects affections; and the King himſelf induced by ſeveral apprehenſions, oppoſed it: See here very conſiderable obſtacles to be removed.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs the Queen-Mother, who with good reaſon grounded on her own, &amp; the Intereſt of the State, was very zealous for this mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, deſpairs not, but begins her deſign with an attempt to gain the Colonel <hi>d' Ornano,</hi> who was formerly the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi>'s Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, and continuing ſtill his Favourite had a great influence on him: To this end, ſhe gets him made Marſhal of <hi>France;</hi> but what ever promiſes theſe honours extracted from him, they quickly vaniſhed, as ſoon as he ſaw the Princeſs of <hi>Conde,</hi> whoſe beauty and attractions raiſed in him ſo much love and vanity, as totally blinded him; ſo that being careſſed and ſued to of all hands, he loſt himſelf in that Maze of felicity: the better to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on his own deſigns with her, he pretends to the Queen-Mother that his ſervices are wholly bent to effect her deſires, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure her contentment, when really the charms of that Princeſs had drawn him entirely to her devotion; 'Twas ſhe alſo governed the Queen, propoſing to her the diſreſpect and contempt the Children of the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> would bring upon her; and that if he muſt needs be married, her Siſter the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> would be a more convenient match for him: But all this while this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs hoped that having clearly gained the Marſhall <hi>d' Ornano</hi> to her aſſiſtance, ſhe ſhould in the depth of this Labyrinth find out a way to conduct her own Daughter to the Dukes bed. See here three Parties in one, the Queens, and thoſe of the two Princes of the blood, all which, though for different reaſons, and which they concealed the one from the other, conſpire to impede this
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:170346:66"/>
match; and ſo ſtrenuouſly proſecute their deſires, that the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> abſolutely refuſed her.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time there hapned a private quarrel which was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by many other: <hi>Chalais</hi> Maſter of the <hi>Wardrobe,</hi> having in a Duel ſlain <hi>Pontgibault,</hi> younger Brother to <hi>Ludde,</hi> Nephew to the Marſhall <hi>Schomberg,</hi> and a Favourite of the Duke <hi>d' Elbeuf,</hi> cauſed a great diviſion in the Court; the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> the Count of <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> and the <hi>Grand Prior,</hi> undertook the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Chalais;</hi> the Duke <hi>d' Elbeuf,</hi> with the whole family of <hi>Guiſe</hi> (except the Duke <hi>de Chevreuſe</hi>) favoured the Houſe of <hi>Ludde;</hi> this diviſion laſted all the Winter; at length, <hi>Chalais</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving obtained his Pardon, and ſenſible of his obligations to his Protectors, gave himſelf up wholly to their Intereſts, and was of great uſe to continue the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> in his obſtinacy againſt the marriage with the Princeſs <hi>Montpenſier;</hi> The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of <hi>Condé</hi> alſo diffident of the ſufficiency of her power with the Queen, perſwades her to engage the Dutcheſs of <hi>Chevreuſe</hi> in her party, for that her own Intereſts lying with the other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſhe feared leſt otherwiſe ſhe ſhould divert her: But her will was eaſily brought to a compliance with the Queens; the ſenſe of her great obligations to her, making her promiſe to ſacrifice all her Intereſts to her commands and ſervice. On the other ſide, the Queen-Mother paſſionately proſecutes the accompliſhment of the Marriage; eſpecially the Cardinal, hoping that to effect it againſt ſo many and great oppoſitions, would enlarge the Princeſs of <hi>Mone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſiers</hi> obligations to him ſo, that his power would ſuffer no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution, though misfortune ſhould alien even the Kings affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from him; the Princeſs of <hi>Conti,</hi> Siſter to the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and all their family beſtir themſelves mainly to the ſame end, and by the means of the Duke <hi>d' Elbeuf,</hi> who was a Friend of <hi>Baradas</hi> the Kings Favourite, or elſe of ſome other perſons who engaged themſelves in it, the King was alſo brought about to rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the match too, out of an apprehenſion infuſed to him, that thoſe three factions pretended only a rupture of the marriage, whereas, in effect, their deſign had no other aim but his ruin, to clap him into a Monaſtery, and marry the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> to the Queen: This impreſſion made him now as zealouſly promote, as he had formerly oppoſed the marriage; earneſtly importuning his Brother, and ſending to the Marſhall <hi>d' Ornano,</hi> who returned large proteſtations of obedience to his commands, but that as yet he could not diſcover any diſpoſition in the Duke for it: Thus for ſome time was the Marſhall careſſed and ſued to by all parties.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, the oppoſite Party ſtrengthen themſelves

with a ſupply of all ſuch as hated the Cardinal, eſpecially the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who, (deſirous to repay him the ill office he had lately received by the concluſion of the peace with <hi>Spain,</hi> which expoſed him to the inconvenience of a war with <hi>Genoa,</hi> and the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of <hi>Spain,</hi>) by his Ambaſſador the Abbot of <hi>Scaglia,</hi> propoſes to the Duke a match with the Princeſs of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and by the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument inſtigates him to rid himſelf of the Cardinal, as the only obſtacle to all his deſigns; but the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs his Wife, ſeeing the King varied in his, had not courage enough to perſevere in their reſolutions for the Party they had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, though they were moſt engaged to prevent the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; but indeed ſo great a propenſity was there in their natures to treachery and falſhood, that without any difficulty was this change wrought in them: the one hoping to gain a piece of Land, called <hi>Dun-le-roy,</hi> and was a part of the Crown-land, to joyn it to his Dutchy of <hi>Chasteau-Roux;</hi> and the other, that ſhe might not totally leave the Court the ſeat of her pleaſures and contents; and the better to act their parts, the Prince comes to <hi>Valery,</hi> not far from <hi>Fountainebleau</hi> where the King then was, whither the Princeſs alſo makes ſeveral journies; after which the Marqueſs of <hi>Brezé</hi> Brother-in-law to the Cardinal, makes three voyages thither alſo, but very privately; to whom, as 'tis ſaid he gave an account of all paſſages, adding to, rather then curtailing the relation of any particular, according to the cuſtom of all Informers, that by ſuch means hope to inhance the price of their diſcoveries.</p>
               <p>About this time were intercepted ſeveral packets going into <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Savoy,</hi> which occaſioned the ſecuring of the Marſhal <hi>d' Ornano,</hi> who was yet ſomewhat more ceremoniouſly dealt withall then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, in regard of his Maſter: The King one afternoon commands the Regiment of his guards into the <hi>Baſſe</hi> Court at <hi>Fountainebleau,</hi> under pretence of exerciſing before the Queens; but inſtead of returning to their quarters, they poſſeſſe themſelves of all the advenues of the village, which was alſo ſurrounded by the Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: And the King going very early to bed, not long after roſe again, ſent for he Queen-Mother, the Cardinal, the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and the Marſhall <hi>Schomberg,</hi> with whom he reſolved upon the Arreſt, which was executed by the Captain of the Guard.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the King ſent inſtantly for the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> to let him know that the reaſon of his impriſonment was, becauſe he knew that inſtead of ſerving him according to his duty, the Marſhall infuſed bad Counſels into him: at which the Duke was highly diſpleaſed, and to as little purpoſe diſcovered he his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:170346:68"/>
both in words and geſtures, flies in great fury at the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, demanding of him, if he had been privy to this deſign, who told him that indeed he was not ignorant of it; the ſame demand makes he to the Chancellour, who for not daring to advow the action, loſt his ſeals a few dayes after, and was baniſhed the Court.</p>
               <p>After this Arreſt of the Marſhal, was <hi>Chaudebonne,</hi> a Domeſtick of the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi>'s ſent to the <hi>Baſtille,</hi> as alſo <hi>Modene</hi> and <hi>Deagent</hi> for their old faults: The Count of <hi>Chaſteau-Roux,</hi> and the <hi>Chevalier de Jars</hi> were alſo baniſhed the Court, ſuſpected for having ſo great a dependance on the Queen and the Count of <hi>Soiſſons.</hi> The Marſhal was ſent to the <hi>Bois de Vincennes,</hi> and all the places under his Command ſeized on, the moſt conſiderable of which was <hi>Pont Saint Eſprit</hi> in <hi>Languedoc:</hi> The report of this, made all the Princes and Great ones then at <hi>Paris,</hi> and in no little amazement at this accident, return to their attendance on the Court.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> perſiſts ſtill in his diſcontent, and is more averſe then ever from the marriage with the Princeſs of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſier;</hi> But being yet deſtitute of any ſafe retreat, he is inforced to cover his diſpleaſure with a diſſembled accommodation with the Cardinal; and hunting often about <hi>Fountainebleau,</hi> reſolves one day to go towards <hi>Fleury,</hi> and dine with him, who then lay there; but having notice of the Dukes intentions, and that it was only to do him a diſcourteſie, departs thence before day, comes to <hi>Fountainebleau</hi> juſt as the Duke was riſing, and gave him his ſhirt.</p>
               <p>This little diſcovery rouſes the Cardinal, and makes him very ſollicitous to provide againſt the ſtorms impending over him: he underſtands moreover, that all contrivances againſt his life come from <hi>Savoy,</hi> that the Abbot of <hi>Scaglia</hi> is the chief Inſtrument imployed in it; that the Queen made uſe of the <hi>Dutcheſs</hi> of <hi>Chevreuſe</hi> to animate the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> againſt him, that the Grand Prior irritated by a private diſcontent, is alſo one of the moſt violent againſt him, whereupon he reſolves to ruine thoſe he could, and to rid himſelf of the reſt the beſt he could.</p>
               <p>This was the ground of his irreconcilable hatred againſt <hi>Savoy,</hi> of the ruin of the Grand Prior, <hi>Chalais,</hi> &amp; the Dutch. of <hi>Chevreuſe.</hi> To compaſs his deſign, and prepare his way to the Government of <hi>Britany,</hi> which he coveted for its good Ports, and the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies to execute this new office of Superintendent of the Sea, which he had introduced to ſucceed the ſuppreſſed Admiralty of <hi>France,</hi> he ſuggeſts to the King, that the Duke of <hi>Vendoſme</hi> grew too potent in <hi>Britany,</hi> conſidering his pretenſions to that
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:170346:69"/>
Dutchy in the right of his Wife, and the alliance he was entring into with the Duke of <hi>Retz,</hi> who was very powerful in that Province, and Maſter of two of the moſt conſiderable places in it; that the Grand Prior, the moſt zealous of all the Duke of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jou</hi>'s Partiſans, was his brother; that it might be one day a moſt ſecure retreat for the Duke, and of dangerous conſequence to all <hi>France,</hi> conſidering its ſituation both ſo near to <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> and that it would be expedient to provide timely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions againſt ſuch fatal accidents. This made the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve upon a journey thither, and to ptepare himſelf for it, the whole Court removed back to <hi>Paris;</hi> but the better to conceal the intended voyage, they pretended only a journey to <hi>Blois;</hi> Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs the Grand Prior rightly conceiving that a further progreſs was deſigned, offers to ſeek out his Brother, and bring him to juſtifie himſelf againſt all accuſations whatever; provided he might be ſecured by an engagement of their words, not to be inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in his perſon: this he imparts to the Cardinal, who approves of his deſign, fils him with hopes, but no promiſe of ſecurity, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing him to procure that of the King, which he does, and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts for <hi>Britany.</hi>

               <p>The Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> was very unwilling to this Journey, but finding no evaſion for it, at length reſolves upon it: All the Court go, except the Count of <hi>Soiſſous,</hi> and the Princeſs of <hi>Montpenſier,</hi> whom the ſickneſs of their Mothers ſtayed behind. The King being at <hi>Blois,</hi> thither came the Duke of <hi>Vendoſme</hi> and his Brother: For two dayes together the King made them infinite careſſes, which the third night he cloſes with an Arreſt by the Captain of his guards, and then ſent them both Priſoners to the Caſtle of <hi>Amboiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this was done, the Cardinal, who had all this while ſtayed at one of his houſes near <hi>Paris,</hi> comes to <hi>Blois,</hi> openly commiſerating the misfortune of the Grand Prior, but not his Brother, in which the whole Court ſympathize, for that the one was beloved, but the other hated; and that which moſt moved their compaſſion, was, that the Grand Prior had moſt innocently been the Inſtrument of both his own and Brother's diſaſter. The reſolution for the voyage into <hi>Britany</hi> is continued, and alſo to preſs the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> to the marriage, who ſtill oppoſed it: But ſome of his Party, fearing leſt at length he might recede from his reſolution, adviſe him to quit the Court: Some counſelling him to take the way of <hi>Rochelle,</hi> others that of <hi>Metz:</hi> Moreover they ſend to the Count of <hi>Soiſſons</hi> for <hi>Balagny</hi> and <hi>Boyer,</hi> two truſty perſons, the one to be his conductor towards <hi>Rochelle,</hi> if they took that way, and the other to treat with his Uncle the

Duke of <hi>Villars</hi> Governor of <hi>Havre,</hi> that they might ſecure that Port to receive the forraign ſuccours promiſed them. But as 't is uſual in all dangerous enterprizes, mens hearts failing them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of executing their deſigns, they raiſe difficulties to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw them, ſo hapned it in this; For inſtead of going them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they ſent a Gentleman belonging to <hi>Chalais,</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Valette</hi> to know whether he would receive the diſcontents, and by that means gave him opportunity to evade a buſineſs, in which, had they ſurprized him, he had without reſiſtance been engaged: For conceiving by this meſſage that they were not well reſolved, he ſent them word, that the place belonging to his Father the Duke <hi>d' Eſpernon,</hi> he muſt firſt ſend to know his pleaſure, before he could return them any other anſwer: This very well pleaſed thoſe that diſſwaded his departure, eſpecially <hi>Chalais</hi> who was of a mild temper, and naturally averſe from faction; to which his friends had never inclined him, had not his ſpirit been too flexible to withſtand their ſolicitations; ſo that ſeeing the trouble and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſtill increaſe, he grew very deſirous to diſ-entangle himſelf of the affair, and to that end, intreats the <hi>Commandeur de Valencé</hi> to aſſure the Cardinal, that he would renounce the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi>'s Intereſts, and become his ſervant; The Cardinal who deſired nothing more, receives and cajoles him ſo handſomly, that he engages him by promiſe, to diſcover all the Dukes deſigns to him: This laſted a few dayes; but the inconſtancy of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, which yet was nothing miſcheivous, hurrying him to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther change; he repents of his promiſe, will diſcover nothing, and raccomodes himſelf with the Duke of <hi>Anjou;</hi> requeſting the <hi>Commandeur</hi> to revoke the promiſe he had given the Cardinal in his behalf, who excuſes himſelf of the employment, foretelling him, that it was the next way to a Priſon or worſe; But <hi>Chalais</hi> notwithſtanding, perſiſting in his reſolutions, got ſome other to carry his intentions to the Cardinal, who nothing reliſhed the meſſage, which recalled to his mind the buſineſs of <hi>Fleury,</hi> and gave him ſome Jealouſies that it was the Dutcheſs of <hi>Chevreuſe</hi> that had regained him, and therefore he thought it now time to diſpatch him: Wherefore he cauſes him to be arreſted and ſent Priſoner to the Caſtle of <hi>Nantes;</hi> and Commiſſioners of the Parliament of <hi>Britany</hi> were appointed for his trial; at which he confeſſes, and accuſes, what, and whom they pleaſe; thinking by that means (being little verſed in criminal proceedings) to ſave himſelf, confirms alſo ſome flying reports of his engagement to kill the King who was helping him to bed; but he was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and executed for this only, that being a Domeſtick of the Duke of <hi>Aujou</hi>'s, he had adviſed his Maſter to retire from the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:170346:70"/>
Court: But after all theſe weakneſſes, ſeeing how ineffectual they had been to ſave his life, he dyed with much courage and conſtancy; At the ſame time alſo was <hi>Marcillac</hi> apprehended, and deveſted of his Government of <hi>Sommieres</hi> in <hi>Languedoc; Troncon</hi> and <hi>Sanveterre</hi> were alſo baniſhed the Court, for preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to diſſwade the King from the intended marriage: To which the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> during thoſe procedures, was anew urged; and his Favourites being already won, the Duke upon hopes of the Marſhal <hi>d' Ornano's,</hi> and <hi>Chalais</hi> liberty, at length reſolves upon it, and falling from one extremity to another, ſuddenly and privately marries the Princeſs of <hi>Montpenſier,</hi> (who was purpoſely ſent for from <hi>Paris</hi> with a gallant train) loves and careſſes her, and now cannot live without her. Hereupon his Appanage was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned him, to wit, the Dutchyes of <hi>Orleans</hi> and <hi>Chartres</hi> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the future we ſhall call him the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi>) toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Earldom of <hi>Blois;</hi> great in appearance, but ſeated in the heart of <hi>France,</hi> without any good place within the whole circuit of it, and of a very ſmall revenue, his chiefeſt aſſignations for the maintenance of his houſe being out of the Treaſury, that ſo they might at pleaſure be taken from him.</p>
               <p>The marriage thus conſummared, they proceed notwithſtanding to the execution of <hi>Chalais,</hi> inquiring alſo after informations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Duke of <hi>Vendoſme,</hi> eſpecially whether he held not Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence with the Duke of <hi>Soubize,</hi> during the war in the year 1625. Commiſſioners alſo were appointed for the trial of the Duke, and his Brother the Grand Prior; but the one objecting the Priviledge of his Peerage, and the other of his Croſs of <hi>Malta,</hi> they were at laſt ſent to the <hi>Bois de Vincennes,</hi> without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proceedings againſt them; only the Dukes houſes in <hi>Britany</hi> were razed, and he was deprived of his Government of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, which was conferred on the Marſhal <hi>Themines.</hi> 'Twas thought the reaſon that diverted the Cardinal from the deſign he had upon this Government, was, that having placed into <hi>Breſt,</hi> one of the faireſt and ſecureſt Ports of all <hi>France,</hi> one <hi>Sourdeac,</hi> a creature of his own, out of hopes to ſecure it to himſelf; the King without his privity, conferred that command upon a Souldier of mean quality, which vexed him ſo, that abandoning all fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thoughts of the other, he reſolved upon the purchaſe of <hi>Hauvre de Grace</hi> in <hi>Normandy.</hi>

               <p>The voyage of <hi>Britany</hi> having thus ſucceeded, the King returns to <hi>Paris,</hi> where the Count of <hi>Soiſſons</hi> durſt not expect his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, but grown wiſe by the misfortune of others, travels into <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> where the Court-hatred purſued and perſecuted him; For Letters were ſent to <hi>Bethune</hi> Embaſſadour extraordinary for the King at <hi>Rome,</hi> that he ſhould take care the title of <hi>Highneſs</hi> was not given him; to which <hi>Bethune</hi> having no other paſſion then for his Maſters ſervice, anſwers, that he would never be guilty of ſuch a crime, but that if the Count of <hi>Soiſſons</hi> had offended the King, he ought to puniſh him in <hi>France,</hi> and not in that which would ſo much intrench upon the honour of the Crown; and that he would rather quit his employment, then do ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervice both to his Maſter and Family.</p>
               <p>When the Court came to <hi>Paris,</hi> not a word was ſpoken of the Dutcheſs of <hi>Chevreuſe</hi> her removal; <hi>Sardigny</hi> and <hi>Bonoeil</hi> were confined to their own houſes, one being accuſed for adviſing the Count of <hi>Soiſſons</hi> to leave <hi>France,</hi> the other for his too great propenſity to the Queens ſervice.

               <p>We will now leave the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> to comfort himſelf with the embraces of his new Wife, for the loſſes and misfortunes of his ſervants; and the Cardinal to refreſh himſelf awhile, after having diſſipated ſo thick, and menacing a cloud, as hovered over his head, to come to the affairs of <hi>England;</hi> whither the Abbot <hi>Scaglia,</hi> four moneths before, was gone in quality of Ambaſſadour extraordinary, and carried together with his Maſters, his own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular paſſions, both being unanimouſly bent to ſpare nothing, that might purchaſe them a ſound revenge upon the Cardinal, There he found the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> of the ſame humour, whom he encouraged to procure the baniſhment of all the <hi>French</hi> attending on the Queen of great <hi>Britany,</hi> for that they cheriſhed their Miſtreſs in ſome froward humours, which many times occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned differences between the King and her, alledging that <hi>Spain, France,</hi> and <hi>Savoy</hi> would be ſufficient preſidents to warrant the action; recounts the numerous factions and diſcontents he had left in <hi>France,</hi> the ill uſage of thoſe of the Religion, in whoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts the King himſelf was engaged, as being ſurety for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of the laſt treaty of peace, and aſſures him of his Maſter the Duke of <hi>Savoyes</hi> complyance and fidelity upon all occaſions; All theſe perſwaſions joyned with the urgent ſollicitations of the Duke of <hi>Soubize,</hi> in the behalf of thoſe of the Religion, moved the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> to perſwade the King his Maſter private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:170346:71"/>
to ſend a Gentleman to the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> to inform him of his deep reſentments that thoſe of the Religion had by his means and intervention been deceived, that he now ſaw clearly, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of reſtoring <hi>Rochelle</hi> to its liberty, preſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they ſuffered in <hi>Languedoc;</hi> that it was expedient they ſhould addreſs their complaints to him, that, being Caution for the late peace, he might have juſt occaſion to demand reparation for the infractions of it, which if it was refuſed, he proteſted that he would employ the whole ſtrength of all his dominions, and hazard alſo his own perſon to obtain an exact and punctual obſervation of the Edict for peace: But that ſince it was fitting, for the better Juſtification of his procedures, to begin with ſuch formalities, he deſires that he would ſend him over a Gentleman, by whom he might be fully informed and directed how to proceed.</p>
               <p>The Duke who ſaw no humane means to preſerve <hi>Rochelle</hi> but by relief from <hi>England,</hi> received this Meſſage with all reſpect and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; and informed the Gentleman, that the Communalties of the Religion could not write to the King his Maſter neither in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, nor in particular without being detected, which would cruſh the affair in its birth, that he would undertake that office for them all, by ſending a Gentleman with a Letter, to implore that aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of him, he was obliged to give them; who moreover ſhould be fully inſtructed with the particular in obſervations of the peace, and what he thought was the moſt convenient courſe to be taken in reference to the war: With this anſwer the Gentleman returned, and a few dayes after, according to his promiſe, the Duke diſpatcht St. <hi>Blancart</hi> with orders to go by the way of <hi>Rochelle,</hi> to ſee in what condition was the Citadel of Saint <hi>Martin</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Ré;</hi> which he exactly well performed, and after his arrival in <hi>England,</hi> obtained a concluſion of a war for our relief.</p>
               <p>In the mean while the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> cauſes all the Queens <hi>French</hi> Servants (except a Chaplain) to be caſhiered, which made ſo great a noiſe in <hi>France,</hi> that the Marſhall <hi>Baſſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piere</hi> was ſent Embaſſadour extraordinary into <hi>England</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the affair, and returned thence with ſatisfaction correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to his inſtructions and intentions: But the two Favourites ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord not at all; he of <hi>France</hi> cauſes the Marſhal, being no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his to be diſowned, and the other procures a diſſolution of the treaty.</p>
               <p>Not long before, the taking of ſome <hi>Normande</hi> ſhips by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> gave another occaſion of difference; The Parliament of <hi>Roüen</hi> hereupon not receiving that ſpeedy ſatisfaction they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, laid an <hi>Embargo</hi> upon all <hi>Engliſh</hi> Veſſels in all their Ports,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:170346:71"/>
and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> upon the reciprocal and fruitleſs complaints of both Parties, made Prize of all the <hi>French</hi> they met with.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who in all theſe affairs acted nothing out of affection to religion, or regard to his Maſters honour, but only to ſatisfie his paſſion for ſome fooliſh Amours of his in <hi>France,</hi> upon theſe two occaſions grounds a requeſt to be ſent Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour to <hi>France;</hi> Thus from the petty follies of the Court, ſprings the diſturbance of whole Kingdoms, moſt of the miſcheifs that infeſt them flowing from the particular Intereſts of Favourites, who trampling Juſtice under their feet, ſubvert all good policy, change the good Maximes of the State, and make their Maſters but properties to ſupport their greatneſs, wealth and revenge.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> jealous of this Embaſſie, ſent one of his Gentlemen very privately to <hi>Paris,</hi> to obſerve the actions of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and to encourage him in his former reſolution: But the King would not admit of his Embaſſie, ſo that his deſign of Love being fruſtrated, he now followes the dictates of his rage, and ſince he could not ſee the object of his paſſion, reſolves to ſhew the King his power, preparing all things for the war, in which, by his preſent care and aſſiduity, he redeems his former negligence and remiſneſs; and that he might omit nothing that might further his deſign, the Lord <hi>Montague</hi> is ſent into <hi>Savoy,</hi> and thence to the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> where arriving very privately, he delivers his Credentials from the King, and from <hi>Buckingham,</hi> in whoſe names he aſſures himof the great preparations in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> for our aſſiſtance, to wit, of thirty thouſand men to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed into three ſeveral Fleets, the firſt deſigned for the Iſle of <hi>Ré,</hi> the ſecond coming up the river of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> to land in <hi>Guienne,</hi> and the third in <hi>Normandy,</hi> to give the King a ſound di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion there, whil'ſt he ſhould be buſied in <hi>Guienne;</hi> that the Rivers of <hi>Loire, Seine,</hi> and the <hi>Garonne</hi> ſhould with good Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots be kept cloſely blocked; that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> would make an invaſion either upon <hi>Dauphine</hi> or <hi>Provence,</hi> and moreover pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> five hundred auxiliary horſe, and the Duke of <hi>Chevreuſe</hi> alſo the like number; that his deſire was, that with thoſe thouſand horſe, and the foot he ſhould levy in <hi>Lakguedoc,</hi> he would march to <hi>Montauban,</hi> to rally thoſe of the Religion in <hi>Guienne,</hi> and joyn with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army, that ſhould make its diſcent by the River of <hi>Bourdeaux:</hi> To which he replyed, that immediately upon the entry of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> and not before, he would engage himſelf to take arms, and procure the lower <hi>Languedoc,</hi> the <hi>Sevenes, Roüergue,</hi> and a part of the higher <hi>Languedoc</hi> to declare, and upon his own ſcore to raiſe four thouſand foot, and two hundred horſe to march to <hi>Montauban;</hi>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:170346:72"/>
and moreover, if he had half the Cavalry promiſed him, he would undertake to joyn the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army in any part of <hi>Guienne</hi> what, ſoever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mourague</hi> returned ſatisfied with this anſwer, and the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> began his preparations, which yet he could not make with that ſecreſie, but that the Court had ſoon an inckling of them; ſo that his Mother and Siſter had been made Priſoners, had they not ſought their ſafety by flying to <hi>Rochelle,</hi> where they did emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently contribute to the defeating of the King's deſigns there; and as all contrivances againſt him, were clandeſtine and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, ſo, for his part did he cheriſh thoſe of the Religion in their diſcontens, eſpecially concerning the Conſulates of <hi>Niſmes</hi> and <hi>Aletz,</hi> whoſe accomodations he prevented, ſo that he preſerved thoſe Corporations in a firm reſolution to dare all extremities, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then ſuffer the leaſt diminution of their Priviledges, and all the reſt in a condition to adhere to them; And on the other ſide, the Court faction having intereſſed the Royal authority in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of thoſe Conſulates, would not in the leaſt degree recede from their purpoſes.</p>
               <p>When things were in this poſture, about the twentieth of <hi>July</hi> comes the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> into the Rode of <hi>Rochelle,</hi> with a brave Armado, in which were ten thouſand men, with ſtore of Canon, and ammunition for war, with all ſorts of Inſtruments for Pioneers: which when the <hi>Rochellers</hi> ſaw, inſtead of receiving him whom they had ſo impatiently expected, they ſhut their gates and havens againſt him, to prevent the arrival of any one from him, to impart his Commiſſion to them; for the Maior and thoſe in authority were corrupted by the Court Party, and the poor people had neither ſtrength, nor courage to admit him: So that <hi>Soubize</hi> was fain to go on ſhore in a Shalloup, and landing near to one of the Town-Gates with one of the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Secretaries, his Mother went ſtraight to another, whither when the Duke was alſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>e, ſhe went forth and drew him in by the arm, at which the People much rejoyced, and in great troops fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him to his lodging: When he was thus gotten in, he aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the Councel of the Town, to whom the Secretary declared the ſubſtance of his Meſſage after this manner; That the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> had ſent him to let them know, that by the command of the King his Maſter, he was now come in ſight of them with a Gallant Army, ready to land where occaſion ſhould require; that that which induced his King to this, was his certain knowledge that the Councel of <hi>France,</hi> (corrupted by the houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi>) conſpired the ruine of all Chriſtendom; which manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the affairs of <hi>Germany,</hi> which they have entirely ruined,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:170346:72"/>
eſpecially by that permiſſion was given to Count <hi>Mansfields</hi> Army to paſs through <hi>France,</hi> which, as he was ready to march, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed him, and was the deſtruction of that, and conſequently of the <hi>German</hi> Army, in which twelve thouſand <hi>Engliſh</hi> periſhed by famine; that ſince the King his Maſter had by his Ambaſſadours mediated a compoſing of the late War againſt thoſe of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and engaged himſelf for the faithful obſervation of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Treaty, (and that too with the conſent of the King of <hi>France</hi>) in which, thoſe of the Religion had ſubmitted to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions too harſh for their preſent eſtate to bear; he had ſeen their Confederates of <hi>Italy</hi> deſerted, and the Armies deſigned for their defence, employed to block up their Garriſons, and to reduce this Town to a Conſumption by Famine, the continual cries of which place, and of the whole body of the Reformed party, having by the mediation of the Dukes of <hi>Rohan</hi> and <hi>Soubize,</hi> reathed his eares, and taking notice of the vaſt preparations at Sea, cloſely to begirt this Town, and that to that end, by an unrepreſidented act of injuſtice, one hundred and twenty <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhips, with all their Merchandize, Mariners, and Artillery, were ſeized on in time of peace; that for theſe, and many other reaſons, compaſſionating their miſeries, and heavy preſſures, his promiſe alſo to ſee the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles agreed on, performed, obliging him, he now offer'd them a powerful aſſiſtance both by Sea and Land, in caſe they will accept of it, and engage in the War with him, proteſting not to proſecute any particular pretenſion or intereſt whatſoever, ſave only what was accorded to thoſe of the Religion, for which he became Caution: That in caſe the Town refuſe this offer, the Duke ſolemnly proteſts before God, and the world, that he holds his Maſter fully abſolved of all obligations both of Conſcience, and Honour; and that for his part, he ſhall diſpoſe himſelf to execute the reſt of the commands impoſed on him by his Maſter, and that he deſires their clear and ſpeedy anſwer: This Harangue much moved the people, who ſaw no other re-ſourſe, nor hopes of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance then from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Arms; yet ſo prevalent was the faction of thoſe that endeavoured the deſtruction of that poor, and miſerable Town, that with much difficulty were they induced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve on any thing; at length they ſent their Deputies to the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> to give the King of <hi>England</hi> thanks for the care he took of them, and withall to let him know, that having heard, and well conſidered of his Meſſage, repreſenting his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties good intentions to all the Reformed in <hi>France,</hi> of whom they were but a part; that being bound by their Oath of Union to act nothing but by a general and unanimous conſent, they concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their anſwer would be much firmer, and more acceptable to the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:170346:73"/>
King, if it were accompanied with that of the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> and the reſt of the Reformed party, towards whom they were now ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with all ſpeed; beſeeching the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably to interpret this Protraction of the demanded junction, and be a means that it may not be diſpleaſing to the King of great <hi>Britain.</hi> In the mean time they would addreſs their prayers, and vowes to God for the proſperous progreſs of his Arms to a plenary execution of the good, and holy intentions of his Majeſty.</p>
               <p>This anſwer had like to have drawn great prejudice on them of all hands; from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to ſee their great irreſolution, and that they ſhould need a ſpur, who could find no ſafety but in their courage, and audacity; from thoſe of the Religion, inaſmuch as they demanded their advice, not aſſiſtance; Thus in affairs of great conſequence, Councels accompanied with too much circumſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are attended on by no leſs dangers; for they diſcover ſo much fear, as raiſes the courages of enemies, and depreſſes thoſe of friends: The Duke of <hi>Soubize</hi> ſent the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> a particular account of this deputation, and anſwer, by <hi>Saint Blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carte,</hi> and withall, an abſolute aſſurance of the Town of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is now to be obſerved, that when <hi>Soubize</hi> left the Fleet, to know the intentions of the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> two things were agreed on between him, and <hi>Buckingham:</hi> Firſt, that the firſt deſcent ſhould be in the Iſle of <hi>Oleron,</hi> both for the facility of it, there being not above twelve hundred ſouldiers to oppoſe them, nor any fortreſs able to make eight dayes reſiſtance; and alſo for the conveniencies of the place, abounding in corn, and wine, commodious for the maintenance of their Souldiers and Mariners, eaſie to be kept, and that once taken, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Veſſels guarding the Sea, would in ſhort time reduce the Iſle of <hi>Ré</hi> to great extremities; whereas if they made their firſt attempt on the other, which was well ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with ſouldiers, ſufficiently fortified to make a good oppoſition, the ſucceſs of the attempt would be full of hazard, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of uncertainty; the other was not to attempt any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Duke of <hi>Soubize</hi> his return: But when <hi>Saint Blancart</hi> came there to acquaint the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> with the iſſue of his negotiation in <hi>Rochelle,</hi> he found the deſign varied, a diſcent into the Iſle of <hi>Ré</hi> determined, and ready to be executed, which the Duke of <hi>Buckinghem</hi> alſo, not expecting <hi>Soubize</hi> his return, haſtens; whether it was, that he feared leſt <hi>Toiras,</hi> who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready three thouſand foot, and two hundred horſe in the Iſland, ſhould grow too ſtrong, many of the Nobility, and great numbers of ſouldiers flocking thither from all parts; or that he was loth

                  <hi>Soubize</hi> ſhould participate of the honour of the action. At this diſcent there was a ſmart and gallant combate, the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> like a deluge, over-whelming all that oppoſed them, which greatly terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the <hi>Romaniſts;</hi> and had he cloſely purſued the victory, and gone directly to the Fort, according to the advice of the Duke of <hi>Soubize,</hi> who was by that time gotten thither, he had found it em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty both of proviſions and ſouldiers; but the loſs of five dayes idly trifled away, gave <hi>Toiras</hi> leiſure to rally his ſcattered men, and to carry all the proviſions, could be found in the Village, up to the Fort.</p>
               <p>This only fault drew after it many miſchiefs on the reformed party; in this fight was ſlain <hi>Saint Blancart,</hi> (who came thither ſoon enough to land the ſecond man) deſervedly lamented by his party, being a young man, whoſe piety, courage, and prudence emulouſly ſtrove to renown him.</p>
               <p>This diſcent of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> cauſed great commotions at the Court, and, had a ſudden taking of the Fort ſucceeded it, probably a great alteration of affairs had followed: For the ſickneſs, the King, about the ſame time, was ſurpriſed with, the general diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Nobility at the Cardinals favour; the jealouſie of thoſe were but lately engaged with the Duke of <hi>Orleans;</hi> the abode of the <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Soiſſons</hi> in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s known deſires of revenge, for his deſertion by the <hi>French,</hi> were ſufficient grounds for more than ordinary jealouſies; and every one impatiently expected to know the fate of the Fort, that they might declare their affections; which the King well knowing, omitted nothing for its relief; fed the Town of <hi>Rochelle</hi> with hopes of an accommodation, provided they joyned not with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> eſſayed to work upon the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> with offers of large ſums of money, and diſperſed Meſſengers to all the Reformed Towns, to render odious the diſcent of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and to draw from them ſuch Declarations as might ſecure him againſt the fear of their conjunction with them; and prevailed with <hi>Montauban</hi> and <hi>Caſtres</hi> to ſend Deputies to the other Corporations to diſſwade them from it, and by this Argument, that <hi>Rochelle</hi> had not joyned with them.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> who for a long while before had been acquainted with the Artifices of the Court, and particularly knew their <hi>Partiſans</hi> in every Town, fore-ſeeing well that he could not hinder ſuch Declarations, adviſes them to inſert in them the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral clauſe, under the benefit of the Edicts, and all other conceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that ſo he might in convenient ſeaſon diſengage them again, and with hopes of good news from <hi>Rochelle,</hi> engages them not to deſert that Town. At length come letters thence, but ſuch, whoſe
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:170346:74"/>
contents anſwered not his deſires; nevertheleſs he is obliged to make uſe of them; but how to extract any advantage out of them, was no ſmall difficulty: If he ſhould ſend them to every Town, they might occaſion divers reſolutions to be taken up by them, and poſſibly contrary the one to the other, which muſt needs cauſe great diviſions; if before he took up Arms, he ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veque an Aſſembly, none of the Corporations would dare ſend their Deputies, for fear of rendring themſelves criminal, which would yet be a greater evil; he reſolves therefore to conceal the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters he had received, &amp; at the ſame time to write ſeverally to all the principal Communalties of the <hi>Sevenes,</hi> (and unknown the one to the other, nor mentioning any Aſſembly) to ſend their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties to him to <hi>Niſmes,</hi> to whom he had things to impart that much concerned them in particular; the ſame deſire ſent he to <hi>Vſez;</hi> hoping that when he had drawn the Provinces of the lower <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and the <hi>Sevenes</hi> to any good reſolution, the reſt of the Reformed party, or at leaſt the greateſt part of them, would eaſily follow their example. This invention ſucceeded well; for all the Deputies came at the time and place prefixed; but the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the Deputies of <hi>Vſez,</hi> being not large enough, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome treachery from that Town, he carried all the Deputies thither, and there formed an Aſſembly, not doubting, by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, to confirm them to his party; this done, he recounts all the breaches of faith during the firſt War; all the infractions of the Edict of peace, made before <hi>Montpellier,</hi> (which occaſioned the loſs of that Town) the continuation of the ſiege of <hi>Rochelle;</hi> the detention of their goods, and the injuſt and cruel execution of many innocent perſons, which was the cauſe of the ſecond; which being compoſed by the inter vention of the King of great <hi>Britain</hi>'s Ambaſſadours, they to obtain a condiſcenſion of thoſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to the Kings propoſals, with the Kings conſent, and in the name of the King their Maſter, became Caution for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the Articles, which being no better obſerved than the former, the danger of <hi>Rochelle</hi> daily increaſing by ſtraitning their Port; the loſs of their Franchiſes, and liberty of Commerce, by the repairing, inſtead of the promiſed razing of the Fort <hi>Lewis;</hi> by the fortifying the Iſlands, and ſtoring them with Ammunition, and other proviſions; by the building, collecting, and arming ſo many ſhips; by maintaining ſo many neighbouring Garriſons; by ſo many attempts upon the Town; by the ſubverſion of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of <hi>Niſmes,</hi> and <hi>Aletz,</hi> depriving them of their liberty of electing Conſuls; by the manifold infringement of the Edicts in all points, and places, and towards all perſons; that the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all theſe things had obliged him to remonſtrate their
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:170346:74"/>
condition to the King of great <hi>Britain,</hi> to implore him, according to his Royal promiſes, to afford us ſome redreſs of our grievances; which ſo prevailed upon him, that after a fruitleſs tryal of all fair means, he had at length reſolved openly to aſſiſt us, and to that end had ſent the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> with a gallant Army, whoſe beginnings were very proſperous: But that it was upon condition, that the lower <hi>Languedoc</hi> ſhould joyn with his forces, and not liſten to any but a General Treaty, and with the conſent of the ſaid King, and of the whole body of the Reformed Party within this Kingdom; adding moreover that the Town of <hi>Rochelle</hi> would not conclude any thing without them: And, with that, ſhewed them the Letters he had thence, telling them, that, conſidering the importance of the affair, he had thought it neceſſary to aſſemble the two Provinces of the <hi>Sevenes,</hi> and the lower <hi>Languedoc,</hi> that there might be a perfect harmony in their reſolutions, which would never have been, had he ſent thoſe Letters to all the Towns ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally; that, moreover, he could not in time of peace convoque an General Aſſembly, whoſe only ſummons would then have proved its prevention: but that he was aſſured that the reſolutions of thoſe two Provinces would charm all the reſt to an imitation: wherefore he conjured them to a ſerious conſideration of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, aſſuring them of his ſtrict and perpetual adherence to them.</p>
               <p>Whereupon they decreed that the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> ſhould be deſired to reſume his charge of General of the Reformed Party, to make leavies of Souldiers and all other things he ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive conducible to their good; that he be deſired to form, as ſoon as may be a General Aſſembly, to continue during the war, for the direction and management of their affairs, that the oath of Union be renewed, with the addition of their Junction with the King of great <hi>Britains</hi> forces, and alſo of all other Princes, Lords and Gentlemen, that for the maintenance of this cauſe have, or for the future ſhall raiſe arms, with a ſubjunction of a promiſe not to accept of any particular peace, nor to conſent or hearken to any treaty, but general, and with the approbation of the whole body of the Reformed Party, and of thoſe Princes with whom they are, or ſhall be united.</p>
               <p>This being done, they all depart: and <hi>Rohan</hi> gives out his Commiſſions, and, that he might not diſguſt the People, raiſes and arms his men at his own expence, appointing a day to make ſome attempts upon ſeveral places: And while he prepares him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for the field, let us reflect upon the Iſle of <hi>Ré,</hi> where we left the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> publiſhing a declaration to juſtifie his Maſters proceedings, and advancing to quarter his army in the Town of Saint <hi>Martin de Ré,</hi> whence he began to ſtraighten the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:170346:75"/>
Citadel, conſiſtingof four Baſtions not yet perfected; andhaving no out-works to defend it: This place he reſolved to reduce, by ſtarving it, preſuming they had but ſmall ſtore of proviſions in it; and that being Maſter of the Sea, he might eaſily prevent the entry of any recruits either of men or victuals; but being ſomething too careleſs in blocking them up, he contents himſelf with ſtopping up the Haven with boats and beams laid a croſs it, ſurrounding the Fort with his Army, and the Iſland with his Fleet, but diſdaining to take a ſmall Fort in the Iſland, which held for the King, and was ſeated on one of the beſt landing places in it: whence afterwards iſſued all the miſchiefs that befel him.</p>
               <p>Beſides thoſe errors, were committed alſo theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of raiſing a work towards the Sea, the only quarter to be ſeared a very frivolous and uſeleſs one was raiſed on the Land, and three Batteries, but at a diſtance, rather to affright, than hurt: A Well alſo was not well heeded, about five and twenty, or thirty paces from the Counterſcarp, in which was only thrown a dead horſe, and ſome ſtones to cover it; but the beſieged know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of what dangerous conſequence that loſs would be to them, disfurniſhing them of water in the Fort, quickly uncovered it, and having well cleared it, fortified it with a work, which preſerved it them during the whole Siege: The Guards alſo were not well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered towards the Sea; nor could the re-iterated advice of the Duke of <hi>Soubize</hi> ever induce them to divide their Ships, and place them before the Ports, where they would have much prejudiced the Romiſh Party. Nay, it was yet worſe; for upon very light pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, every day came one or other from the Fort, to ſpeak with the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and diſcover the condition of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and from that time, by the means of the Baron <hi>De Saint Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin</hi> and <hi>Montaut,</hi> were ſet on foot on divers Treaties, which were continued till ſuch time, as the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> diſpatch'd one of his Nephews to the Court with the ſaid <hi>Saint Surin,</hi> but for what reaſon, was not known to the Duke of <hi>Soubize.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for the better underſtanding of this Affair, it is to be known that <hi>Ré</hi> is an Iſland, lying about a League from <hi>Rochelle,</hi> ſeven miles in length, and of great fertility, eſpecially in wine, and ſalt: There are in it, three principal <hi>Bourgs,</hi> or unwalled Towns, of which <hi>Saint Martin De Ré</hi> is one of the faireſt of <hi>France,</hi> and ſeated on the beſt Rode of all that Coaſt: There is alſo a fair Port, which ſtretcheth it ſelf all along the Town, like a little Arm of the Sea; and it was the mouth of that which the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> blocked up, to prevent the introduction of proviſions into the Fort: Between <hi>Rè,</hi> and <hi>Broüage</hi> lies another Iſland, called <hi>Oleran,</hi> as big, and populous as the other, but much
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:170346:75"/>
more fruitful; in which the King had garriſon'd a Fort, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uil there by the Duke of <hi>Soubize</hi> in the former War, but of ſmall conſideration; had <hi>Buckingham</hi> ſeized upon this Iſland, where almoſt all the Inhabitants are of the Religion, he had then totally defeated the Fort of <hi>Rè</hi> of all means of relief.</p>
               <p>The King about this time falling ſick, was conſtrained to ſend the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> in his place, to command, and confirm the Army, which the Duke of <hi>Angouleſme</hi> had about <hi>Rochelle,</hi> where notwithſtanding the <hi>Rochellers</hi> proteſtations by which they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned any confederacy with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> yet was their uſage no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better, but they began now to begirt them more cloſely by Land, to retrench all manner of Proviſions: but the main deſign of the Army chiefly reflected upon the Fort of <hi>Ré,</hi> to recruit that with men, and victuals, in which they ſpared no expence, neither of men, nor money; ſo that at ſeveral times they got in ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent numbers to keep it till its entire deliverance.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Rochellers,</hi> after they had oſten, but in vain, renewed their proteſtations of fidelity and obedience, ſeeing that all their ſubmiſſions, neither abated their ſufferings, nor the malice of thoſe who thirſted for their ruine, but only fomented diviſions among thoſe of the Religion, and furniſhed the ill-affected with ſpecious pretences to exclaim againſt the others; at length remonſtrate how that they had with-drawn themſelves from the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> to ſubject themſelves to that of <hi>France,</hi> the great priviledges they had acquir'd by it, their good ſervices ever ſince, their immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fidelity, in which they had conſtantly perſevered, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the deſtruction of their Trade, the conſuming of their Harveſts, the devaſtation of their Countrey, the cruelties exerciſed upon their Citizens; in ſhort, all thoſe miſeries which a licentious Army in many years can inflict upon their greateſt enemies; and after this ſaid repetition of their ſufferings, openly declare for the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> he alſo publiſhes a Declaration, containing the infractions of the two former peaces, the reaſons he had to reſent them, and makes his Addreſſes to the King of great <hi>Britain,</hi> who was Caution for the latter; proteſts that he has no other aime, than at the obſervation of the Edicts, which once granted, he freely offers to expoſe himſelf to a voluntary exile from the Kingdom, that ſo there might be no ground left for future pretences and jealouſies. On the other ſide, the King alſo iſſues forth new Declarations, in which he promiſes an obſervation of the Edicts to thoſe that ſhall perſiſt in their obedience, a pardon to thoſe that had flown from it, if within a certain time they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to it, denouncing heavy ſecurities againſt the perſons, and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:170346:76"/>
eſtates of ſuch as ſhall adhere to the Reformed Party; the Duke of <hi>Soubize</hi> was proclaimed Traytour; and the Parliament of <hi>Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louze,</hi> though it has no juriſdiction over the Peers of <hi>France,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> to be torn in pieces with foure horſes, proclaimed him ignoble, and ſet a price of fifty thouſand Crowns upon his head, ennobling thoſe that ſhould aſſaſſinate him, which encouraged three or four unhappy Villains to attempt it; but they came ſhort of any other recompence than a Halter, or a Wheel; it being not within the compaſs of any humane power, without an eſpecial permiſſion of the Divine, either to prolong, or ſhorten the life of any man.</p>
               <p>Theſe light skirmiſhes of the pen thus diſpatched, come we now to the more fatal ones of the Sword; of all the deſigns con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, and promiſed to the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> to be put in execution upon divers places, in ſeveral Provinces, none took effect, but that of <hi>Corconne,</hi> the management of which, he had committed to the Lieutenant of his Guards, together with one named <hi>De Pize,</hi> (who in a ſhort time after, gave it back to the enemy again) The chiefeſt obſtacle of it was, the peoples refuſal to allow of any ſuch attempts, before an open Declaration of the War: So that at the beginning of this, there was not any Paltry Village, or Fort, that ſtood not upon his Guard; a thing not heard of in the former Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Wars, when men were more zealous for their Religion, more faithful, ſecret, and confident of their Commanders, to whom they gave ſo great reſpect, that their bare Tickets only were ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to engage them in a War, and to attempt the moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble places of the Kingdom; whereas now the Irreligion and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyalty of thoſe of the Religion, is more difficultly oppoſed, than the malice of their enemies.</p>
               <p>About this time, <hi>Montague</hi> ſent him an Expreſs, importing, that the intentions of a Diſcent to be made in <hi>Guyenne,</hi> were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and that for this Summer the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> would make no invaſion but about the Coaſt of <hi>Rochelle;</hi> ſo that the King of great <hi>Britain</hi> diſcharged him of his promiſe to march to <hi>Montauban,</hi> leaving him at liberty, to make choice of what place he pleaſed for this Summers action; but that the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> with whom he was, was of opinion, that he might make a more advantagious progreſs along the <hi>Rhone,</hi> than in any other quarter, and promiſed to give the enemy a good diverſion in his: But all theſe deſigns were projected with reference to the taking of the Fort of <hi>Ré,</hi> of which there was not the leaſt umbrage of a doubt. The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> took this Expreſs into conſideration, and would willingly have made his firſt Exploits in thoſe quarters, had he not been neceſſitated to reclaim the Towns of <hi>Roüergne,</hi>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:170346:76"/>
and the higher <hi>Languedoc,</hi> who in his abſence had been inveigled into reſolutions contrary to his, and their determinations alſo ſent to the King; ſo that nothing but his preſence was capable to make them take Arms; which fixed him in his former purpoſes, for which he ſent <hi>Montague</hi> his Reaſons, aſſuring him however, that, if the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> would inſtantly take the Field, he would quit all other deſigns to joyn Forces with him; but that otherwiſe it would be expedient to remit that Affair till another time: And ſo, leaving the Baron <hi>D' Aubais,</hi> to command the lower <hi>Langue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc,</hi> and a Council in the <hi>Sevenes,</hi> to govern their Affairs there; he marched with his whole Force, compoſed of four thouſand five hundred Foot, and two hundred Horſe, directly towards <hi>Millaud;</hi> and in his March, took <hi>Pont D' Arre,</hi> a private Gentlemans houſe, and <hi>Arigas</hi> a Church that was fortified, and very much incommoded the Bayliwick of <hi>Vigan;</hi> whiles he ſtayed at <hi>Saint John De Breüill, Alterac,</hi> and <hi>Guerin,</hi> two of his <hi>Partiſans</hi> in <hi>Millaud</hi> came to meet, and diſſwade him from that attempt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the difficulties attending it, and that as ſoon as <hi>Montau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> and <hi>Caſtres</hi> had declared, they would do the like.</p>
               <p>The Duke told them they had done very ill to come out of the Town, which they had left to the diſpoſal of thoſe that were diſaffected to them; that it would be the ruine of his deſigns, and a Preſident for all the Towns of <hi>Roüergue</hi> to ſhut their Gates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; that he could not begin with <hi>Montauban,</hi> and <hi>Caſtres;</hi> for that <hi>Millaud</hi> lay directly in his way to them; and that he was reſolved with all his Troops to get in, or ravage their whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; deſiring them to go before, and give them notice of it: But they found how their abſence had encouraged the adverſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who having ſhut the Gates of the Town, and thoſe of the Bridge over the River <hi>Tarn,</hi> where they muſt of neceſſity paſs, they could not obtain a re-admittance, but were enforced to return to the Duke with the newes; which yet ſtopped him not, who well ſaw the neceſſity of proſecuting this deſign; hoping that the ſight of him would animate the people to an inſurrection; who failed not his expectation: For having with much difficulty and peril, by reaſon of the depths and largeneſs of the River, paſſed over ſome of his Guards, who laying at the Gates of the Bridge on both ſides, they at length fell down, and gave him free paſſage to the Suburbs, where taking ſome Horſe, and his Trumpets, and in that Equipage marching round the Town, he ſo excited the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that under the favour of the night, without any oppoſition, they meet all with their Armes, and forcing the Conſuls to open the Gates, went themſelves to conduct him into the Town.</p>
               <p>This ſucceſs made him way into all the Towns of <hi>Roüergue,</hi>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:170346:77"/>
and of the Mountain of <hi>Albigeois,</hi> except <hi>Braſſac,</hi> and <hi>Saint Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix</hi> Tower, where he left ſome Regiments with <hi>Vacquereſſe,</hi> who had already blocked up this Tower, and having ſprung a Mine, took it upon compoſition; whereupon <hi>Braſſac,</hi> at the end of four and twenty houres yielded alſo: But <hi>Saint Germier,</hi> who carried on his buſineſs at <hi>Castres,</hi> behaved himſelf ſo ill, that he ſuffered himſelf, with all his Confidents to be turned out of the Town: This Preſident made <hi>Realmont, Briteſte,</hi> and the three Towns of <hi>Eauraguais;</hi> viz. <hi>Puylaurens, Revel,</hi> and <hi>Soreze</hi> refuſe alſo to declare; ſo that he was fain to come with his Cavalry to <hi>Roque-Courbe,</hi> a little Town, about one League diſtant from <hi>Castres,</hi> and two from <hi>Realmont;</hi> whence he made ſeveral Eſſayes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce thoſe two refractory places; at <hi>Castres</hi> he prevailed nothing at all; at <hi>Realmont</hi> his perſwaſions met a more civil reception, and their Gates, that refuſed the Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> admitted him; there he placed <hi>Maugis</hi> Governour, who had been moſt active in doing him this ſervice, and very faithful to him in the precedent Wars.</p>
               <p>The reduction of this place was ſome enlargement to him; thither he ſummoned the Colloque of <hi>Albigeois,</hi> which he wrought to reſolutions conformable to his own; but before he could advance any farther, <hi>Puylaurens,</hi> or <hi>Revel</hi> muſt of neceſſity be ſecured; otherwiſe it were impoſſible he ſhould adventure to go either to <hi>Montauban,</hi> or into <hi>Foix,</hi> being to march twelve or fifteen Leagues in an enemies Countrey, and that over great Plains too, having the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> attending on him, who had drawn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the whole ſtrength of the Country to fight him, and was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes double or treble ſtronger in Horſe than he; it was once in his thoughts to croſs the <hi>Tarn,</hi> but the late abundance of rain had made it unfordable; ſo that having no way but that of <hi>Laura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guais,</hi> and an Army before him, he could not put himſelf upon the hazard of that paſſage without ſome place of retreat. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins therefore with <hi>Puylaurens,</hi> as a place whoſe example would invite all the reſt; <hi>Terrieux,</hi> and <hi>Mauris,</hi> two, whoſe good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices in the former Wars, made him repoſe a great confidence in, promiſed, that if he would give them five hundred piſtols to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute in the Town, they would procure his admittance; but, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of performing what they had engaged themſelves to do, they betray the whole deſign to the Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> to the end he might ſurprize <hi>Caſſagne,</hi> who with his own, and the Baron <hi>d' Aletz</hi> his company, and fifty of the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi>'s Guards, were commanded to execute it; to whom, when they came to the appointed Rendez-vous, the Traytors ſent word, that it was not in their power to effect what they had undertaken; the others ſeeing

themſelves far from any retreat, <hi>Cauſſe Caucallier,</hi> who had very good acquaintance, and <hi>Gaillard,</hi> a brother, in <hi>Revel,</hi> who with <hi>Des-Iſles-Maiſons</hi> were carrying on an infallible deſign there, and which wanted only two dayes to be put in execution, fearing the inconveniencies threatned by the great length of their retreat, made a deſperate propoſal to anticipate the time, and attempt it preſently, which they all aſſented to, and ſucceeded ſo well in, that the people of <hi>Revel</hi> ſeeing <hi>Rohans</hi> Livery, imagining he himſelf was there, and <hi>Gaillard</hi>'s brother, with ſome other of the Inhabitants, having ſeized upon a Tower, favoured their <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calade,</hi> in which they met with no other oppoſition than ſome ſtones thrown at them: Thus they became Maſters of the Town, the news of which made the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> reſolve, inſtantly, and without any further delay to advance.</p>
               <p>In order to which he cauſed fourty thouſand loaves to be made, and leaving <hi>Roque-Courbe</hi> came with part of his forces, and lay at <hi>Arifat,</hi> a houſe not above halfe a League from <hi>Castres;</hi> the next day he marched to <hi>Narrez,</hi> where he appointed his general Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dez-vous, and quarters that night at <hi>Sajes,</hi> where he had intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence that the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> with all his troops lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and <hi>Revel,</hi> whereupon, to diſencumber himſelf of all the Carts he had to carry it, he diſtributed all the bread among his ſouldiers; and the next day having marched about a League, he diſcovered the Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> with three or four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred horſe only: whereupon he rallies his men, and in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der marches in ſight of him, keeping on his way to <hi>Revel,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any rencontre at all, and quartered about a League from <hi>Revel,</hi> where he arrived the next day early.

               <p>The Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> in the meane time, intercepts a Letter written by the Conſuls of <hi>Mazeres,</hi> and addreſſed to the Preſident <hi>de Suc,</hi> importing the inclinations of that Town to joyne with the Reformed party, but that the Duke's preſence was very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to promote the publique Declaration of their intentions; which he took into his ſerious conſideration, and reflecting upon this, that he had yet three dayes march before his Army could reach <hi>Montauban,</hi> no retreat upon the way, that his journey thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was not neceſſary, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> being engaged in other parts, and having good aſſurance of the entire affections of that Town, he thought fit to embrace this offered opportunity of reducing the whole Countrey of <hi>Foix</hi> to his party; This made him reſolve upon that courſe, and, that he might get the ſtart of the enemy,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:170346:78"/>
having cauſed his Souldiers to take bread for two dayes, and quit part of their baggage, he parts from <hi>Revel</hi> at midnight; but by reaſon of the badneſſe of the weather that night, and the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious advenews of the Village, where his foot lay, it was day before his Reare could get out of it; ſo that paſſing by <hi>Montcauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> where a troop of horſe of the enemies were quartered, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of their march towards <hi>Foix</hi> being given, it occaſioned a ſlight skirmiſh, which yet retarded not the armies march: The ſame troop followed his Reare at a diſtance, till they came neare to a little Town called <hi>Soville,</hi> two Leagues from <hi>Revel,</hi> where the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> was ranging his troops in Battalia, as conceiving it the moſt proper place to oppoſe the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi>'s paſſage, and fight him, by reaſon of a fair plain beneath it, very advantageous for his Cavalry, in which he was much ſuperiour, and of a little, but very dangerous brook, all whoſe bridges he had broken down, ſo that he could not paſſe but in ſight of him.</p>
               <p>The Duke whoſe Army conſiſted of four thouſand foot, &amp; fifteen hundred good horſe, made four Battalions of his Infantry, which he ranged in formes of Lozenges, leaving great intervals between them for his Cavalry who faced the enemies army, and could, as they marched, be eaſily ordered to charge them either in Front, Flanck, or Reare; and his baggage placed he in the middeſt of the four Battalions, reſolving in that order either to paſſe, or fight him; But enquiring of his guides, if there were no other paſſage over the brook but that which the enemy poſſeſſed, they informed him, that upon the left hand of him there was a Ford near a little Caſtle, called <hi>de Jean,</hi> where the brook being narrow, there might eaſily be a bridge made for the paſſage of the foot: Thither then marched he directly, leaving the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi>'s Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my on his right hand, and when he had gotten beyond him, very opportunely ſends to take the Caſtle, which two hundred ſouldiers of <hi>Caſtelnaudary</hi> were coming to poſſeſſe, and would mightily have incommoded his paſſage. This done he diſencumbers himſelf of his baggage, which he ſent before over the brook to the Caſtle, and having gained a little hill, between the enemy and the brook, halts there, to obſerve the countenance of the Duke of <hi>Montmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency,</hi> and conſidering what he were beſt to do; Once he thought not to quit the advantage of that place, fearing to march over the brook by day, in view of an army that ſought all advantages to encounter him, and might ſuffer as many as they pleaſed of his men to get over, and then charge the reſt: On the other ſide, conſidering, that if he ſtayed there without proviſions, in an enemies Countrey, an army attending him, and having five long Leagues to <hi>Mazeres,</hi> he feared it would be too great a burthen for
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:170346:78"/>
his ſouldiers to ſupport, ſo that, by the advice of all his Officers, he reſolved to expoſe himſelf rather to the hazard of a battel, than the miſeries of toyle and famine; and when the bridge was made, marched towards it, in the aforeſaid equipage. <hi>Alizon</hi> who had the command of a troop of horſe, and was neareſt the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi>'s Army, being placed upon a hillock, that gave him the proſpect of the whole Countrey every way, let the Army advance too far before him, before he began to draw off; ſo that he was charged by two hundred Horſe, who purſued him home to his Foot in great diſorder, and had like to have Routed them too; but the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi>'s Guards, who were very opportune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on foot, and ready to relieve him, gave them a Volley, and at the ſame inſtant a ſharp charge, and repulſe; this beginning much animated <hi>Montmorency</hi>'s Army, part of his Cavalry, with his Foot alſo, advancing with great ſhouts to the charge; but receiving a ſecond repulſe, and two of the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi>'s Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taillons coming up, with their Pikes charged directly to them, the Foot ſtayed not to expect them; but flying, caſt away their Arms, and quitted the Field; they were cloſely purſued up to a Work, which hindred our diſcovery of what was on the other ſide of it, and ſaved the enemy from an entire defeat: For the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> would not ſuffer his mon to make any confuſed purſuit, becauſe the Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> who had not yet come up to the charge, was beyond that Work, with above three hundred Horſe in Battalla; but commanded <hi>Leques</hi> only to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, to obſerve their poſture.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> when he had rallied his Men, drew them off to <hi>Sovillé,</hi> and there Ranged them again in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taila, but without any ſemblance of renewing the Fight: The Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> for his part, kept the Field more than a long houre, cauſed his dead to be buried, and thanks to be given to God; and then, without any interruption, paſſed the Brook, and kept on his way; but could not reach <hi>Mazeres</hi> till the next day at Noon, after he had been forty houres on horſe-back: In this Fight he loſt <hi>Cauſſe-Caucallier,</hi> one of his Life-guard, one of his Pages, two Lieutenants of Foot, five or ſix Souldiers, and had thirty or forty wounded. Of the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi>'s party, were loſt many more, yet was it no bloody Incounter; and it is to be believed that this engagement of his was rather occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, than before determined; for it ſeems he had more reaſon to charge the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> in his paſſage over the Brook, than in any other part: But 'tis eaſier to correct the actions of others, when a man is out of danger of the blowes, than in the action it ſelf, which requires a prompt and ſudden execution, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:170346:79"/>
not leaſure to perpend, and weigh all events. The Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> had, at this Rencontre, but three thouſand Foot, but he had ſix, or ſeven hundred Horſe of his own, beſides all the Gentry of quality of <hi>Languedoc, Roüergue, Foix,</hi> and ſome from beyond the <hi>Garonne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> came to <hi>Mazeres,</hi> all his men op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with hunger, laſſitude, and want of ſleep, for refreſhment, he found the gates ſhut againſt him, and the Magiſtrates utterly averſe to receive him; but the common people at length took heart, and in ſpight of the Conſuls, and moſt potent Inhabitants, let him in; where, after he had taken the beſt order he could for quartering of his Horſe, he made proviſion for his Foot alſo. When the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> heard of the indiſpoſition of the people of <hi>Foix</hi> to joyne with the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi>'s Forces; he came and took up his quarters at <hi>Saint Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelle</hi> upon the River <hi>Cers,</hi> which runs to <hi>Mazeres,</hi> a good league diſtant from <hi>Saverdun,</hi> whence he ſent to inform them, that he was come thither with his Army for their aſſiſtance, that they ſhould be of good courage, and not ſuffer themſelves to be caught by the allurements of the Duke of <hi>Rohan;</hi> who for eight dayes together, was oppreſſed with the extremity of keeping all his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my upon his own expence, and yet could he hardly furniſh his Foot with one loaf a day each one; having no other place in <hi>Foix</hi> beſides <hi>Mazeres,</hi> and the River <hi>Riege</hi> ſwollen to a height, that making it unfordable, cut off all communication with the upper <hi>Foix:</hi> So, that had theſe inconveniencies laſted but a few dayes longer, he had been in danger of periſhing by Famine if he ſtayed; or by the Sword, if he returned; having no Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to defend himſelf withall: All theſe neceſſities preſſing him, he ſounded ſo many Fordes, till at length having found one between <hi>Saverdun,</hi> and <hi>Pamicz,</hi> which the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> could not ſo ſuddenly reach, he reſolves in this deſperate condition, to make an attempt on <hi>Saverdun,</hi> where he knew the people were well-affected to him, and the lower Town being eaſie to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, he hoped that when he had taken that, fear would induce the other to an accommodation with him; which project had a wiſhed ſucceſs: To this end, he marches by night from <hi>Mazeres</hi> with a part of his Troops, and at break of day paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the <hi>Ford;</hi> but with great difficulty for the Foot, by reaſon of the ſwiftneſs, and extream coldneſs of the River, which then alſo was ſwelled ſo high, that ſome of his Souldiers, and many of his Arms were loſt in it; ſo that at laſt the Horſe were neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to tranſport the remaining Foot behind them; which done, he marches ſtrait to <hi>Saverdun;</hi> where firſt, by a Trumpet he
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:170346:79"/>
ſummoned the Inhabitants to open their Gates; and upon their refuſal advances, and, after, ſome Volleys of ſmall ſhot, which neither ſlew, nor hurt any one, with the aſſiſtance of ſome honeſt perſons of the Town, Ladders were mounted, and the place en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred: The taking of the lower Town, mcuh confounded the ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected; ſome flie, others hide themſelves, at length all cry out for mercy; and the higher Town alſo was ſurrendred on the 12th. of <hi>Novemb.</hi> 1627.</p>
               <p>The ſame day <hi>Faucon,</hi> by the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi>'s order, with two hundred Men, ſecured <hi>Montmaur,</hi> a ſmall Town, and Caſtle lying between <hi>Revel,</hi> and <hi>Mazeres;</hi> but of great conſequence for the uniting <hi>Lauraguais,</hi> and <hi>Foix:</hi> This was effected by the intelligence of <hi>La Barte,</hi> whom the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> had highly diſguſted.</p>
               <p>The Duke vigorouſly proſecutes theſe fortunate ſucceſſes, and upon hopes of ſome Correſpondents in <hi>Pamiez,</hi> on the 22th. of the ſame Month he ſhewes himſelf with his Horſe before it, but had no other entertainment than what they ſent him from their Muſquets; whereupon he determined, the night following, to clap a Petarde to the Wall, to which he was induced by ſome of the Inhabitants, that had given him a meeting near the Town; inſtead then of returning to <hi>Saverdun,</hi> whither he was going, he retires to a Covert, half a league from <hi>Pamiez,</hi> forbidding his men to make any fires; thither he commands <hi>Goudin</hi> and <hi>Malmoirac,</hi> with their Regiments, whom he had before ordered to be in a readineſs; but thoſe that ſhould have come out of the Town to conduct him to the place, and inform him of the true ſtate of it, came not to the Rendez-vous; never theleſs <hi>Bruel,</hi> one of the Town, Author of this enterpriſe, and who knew well enough where the Petarde was to be fixed, being with him, he proceeded in the deſigned attempt, which was executed after this manner. <hi>Caſſagne</hi> had the command and conduct of the <hi>Petards,</hi> which were carried by Gentlemen of his own, and ſome Officers of his Horſe, who were ſeconded by <hi>Leques</hi> with thirty armed Men, and fifty choice Pikes, and Muſquetiers; after whom marched <hi>Goudin,</hi> and <hi>Malmoirac,</hi> then the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in perſon: In this Equipage they come up to the Wall, where, notwithſtanding the Allarme, and Volleys of ſhot, the firſt Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarde was fixed, but the Breach being not large enough, a ſecond was clapped on, which extended it to a ſufficient wideneſs for an armed man to paſs; whither the Inhabitants flocking to defend the Breach, <hi>Bazier</hi> the Engineer, took a ſmall Granade, and threw it in through the Hole among them, where it broke, and ſpoiled the Thigh of one of the Defendants, and diſſipated the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:170346:80"/>
reſt; which gave the Aſſailants opportunity to enter the Breach; the firſt that entred, was <hi>La Tour Cenestoux;</hi> the ſecond, was the Baron of <hi>Villemade,</hi> and after them, the whole Party. The taking of the Town in this manner, ſpread ſo univerſal a terrour over <hi>Foix,</hi> that ſome Forts, well ſtored with all neceſſaries, gave themſelves up for fear. After this the Duke was received into the <hi>Mas d' Azil,</hi> and <hi>Carlat,</hi> by which means he reduced all thoſe, that were of the Religion in the County of <hi>Foix,</hi> to his party; and probably had done much more, had the <hi>Engliſh</hi> enterprizes in the Iſle of <hi>Rè</hi> proſpered; whom it will be now expedient to look after.</p>
               <p>The negligence of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> gave opportunity to thirteen Barks, laden with proviſions, to come up to the Citadel, where they arrived the ſixth of <hi>September,</hi> about the Morning, and got off again the ninth following, carrying with them all the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and unuſeful perſons: The eaſie paſſage of theſe, encouraged others to the like adventure; but, the Guards being re-inforced by the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> ſome of them were taken, and ſeverely dealt withall; and on the laſt of <hi>September,</hi> of fifteen or ſixteen Barks which came up, ſeven were taken, and the reſt put to flight.</p>
               <p>On the twelfth of <hi>September</hi> came from <hi>England</hi> a Renfort of fifteen or ſixteen hundred Souldiers, with a ſupply of all other neceſſaries; whereupon the Duke reſolved to attempt the little Fort <hi>De la Prée,</hi> and turned ſome of his Canon that way; but this deſign was daſhed upon a ſudden, no man knows why.</p>
               <p>On the ſixth of <hi>October,</hi> the beſieged, preſſed by ſtrong ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, ſent out <hi>Montaud</hi> with offers to capitulate, in caſe they were not relieved with victuals the next day: This obliged us to double our Guards, and, as the winde ſate, it was eaſie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture that the relief could not come but from <hi>Oſonne;</hi> whereupon ſome ſhips were commnaded out to meet them, and prevent their paſſage; but, inſtead of that, the Captain of the Guard took another courſe, and went wtih his ſhips to the <hi>Foſſe de l' Oye,</hi> while three and thirty Barks, ſeizing the opportunity, paſſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interruption, and nine and twenty of them came up under the Citadel; where yet it is to be noted, that they could not come near the Land, but upon a great Flood, which comes but every fifteen dayes, by reaſon whereof the <hi>Engliſh</hi> might yet with much facility, have deſtroyed the relief; which though arrived, yet could not be unladen; ſo that Propoſitions were made to the Duke, aſſaulting them on both ſides by Land, to fire the Barks with what was in them: which might have been done without any prejudice received from the Caſtle, by reaſon of the height of the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:170346:80"/>
Banks capable to ſhelter the Aſſailants: He ſeemed to approve of this motion, but took no courſe to put it in act; contenting himſelf only with trifling away the time in vain attempts to fire them by Sea.</p>
               <p>When the relief was gotten in, <hi>Buckingham</hi> calls a Council, who reſolve to draw off; ſo that on the twelſth of <hi>October,</hi> they began to re-imbarque their Armes, and other Ammunitions they had upon the Land: After this he ſent for a Gentleman belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to the Duke of <hi>Soubize,</hi> to whom he declared that the Council of War, conſidering how well the place was ſtored with all neceſſaries, the year ſo far ſpent, his Army much dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and all his Proviſions conſumed, had conceived it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to draw off; The Gentleman endeavoured to diſſwade him from that reſolution, ſhewing him that the Fleet which the Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> was conducting to them, would ſufficiently repaire all thoſe neceſſities; that the relief the Beſieged had received could not laſt long; and that if vigilant guards were kept, they would be ſoon reduced to their former extremities; that his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat now he had engaged them, would be the loſs and ruine of the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> who would caſt all their diſpleaſure and <hi>odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> upon the Duke of <hi>Soubize,</hi> as the Authour of their deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that it would be an irrepatable diſ-reputation to the King his Maſters Arms, to have attempted ſuch an enterpriſe with ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle honor and profit.</p>
               <p>To all which Arguments he gave no other anſwer, than that his Captains would ſtay no longer; but yet, if the Earl of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> came time enough, with his Fleet, he would endeavour to alter their minds: By which the Gentleman concluding that the Duke was fixed in his reſolutions to be gone, gave ſpeedy notice of it to the Duke of <hi>Soubize,</hi> who ever ſince the middle of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> had lain ſick at <hi>Rochelle</hi> of a <hi>tertian</hi> Ague joyned with a great vomiting, deſiring him, if poſſible, to poſt thither; which he did, and at his arrival in the Iſle of <hi>Ré,</hi> uſes all his Art to perſwade the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> and his Officers into a better humour, of which they gave him ſome ſmall hopes; but he, nevertheleſs, ſeeing them ſtill carrying their things aboard, aſſured himſelf they would not budge from their former purpoſes.</p>
               <p>The King, in the mean time, being recovered of his ſickneſs, comes in perſon before <hi>Rochelle;</hi> where his preſence raiſed both the number and ſpirits of his Army, and upon intelligence how the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s was leſſened, reſolves to make a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent into the Iſle of <hi>Ré</hi> under the protection of the little Fort <hi>de la Prée,</hi> which had ſtill held out. On the other ſide the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:170346:81"/>
men's deſire to return, having made them very careleſs of their guards, they ſuffered ſeven or eight pinnaces to ſteal up towards the Fort, and on the ſixteenth of <hi>October</hi> they land four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men; the twenty ſeventh there came up ten more, and on the thirtieth five and twenty; whereupon the Duke of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> rallies his Men; and, quitting the greateſt part of the Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, marches by night, with what horſe and foot he had, to prevent a diſcent already made, commanding out a forlorne of <hi>French,</hi> which not being ſeconded, were enforced to retire. The Merchants of <hi>Rochelle</hi> in the mean time, ſeeing what preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were made for his return, inſtantly ſollicite the Duke to give them fifty or ſixty tunnes of Corn he had upon the Shore, which he aſſented not to, till they had no leaſure to carry it off, ſo that they fell to the enemies ſhare: But before his departure, to ſhew that he had left nothing unattempted, he reſolved to make one eſſay more, which reſolution he grounded upon the report of ſome fugitives from the Fort, who averred that there were but eight hundred ſouldiers in it, and thoſe too for the greateſt part ſick; that the Courtain towards the Sea had neither graffe nor Rampart, ſo that if he mounted his Ladders on that ſide, it might be eaſily forced. Without any further information, or batter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Parapetts, he reſolves to give a general aſſault, propoſes it to the <hi>French</hi> Officers, deſiring them to diſpoſe the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonels to it, and in caſe they ſhould ſtick at it, he would then make uſe of his power to command them. The attempt thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved on, he prepares his men for the ſtorm, aſſigning the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> their poſt on the land ſide, and the <hi>French</hi> mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Engliſh</hi> towards the Sea: <hi>Manuel</hi> conducted the ten firſt Ladders, but could mount but two, though his party beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved themſelves with much gallantry and reſolution; (but to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to force by <hi>Eſcalade</hi> above fifteen hundred Men in a Fort with four <hi>Bastions,</hi> well furniſhed with Artillery, and all other neceſſaries, was a way eternally to diſcourage his Souldiers, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to lead them on to the purchaſe of any honour) but lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving many dead, and carrying off more wounded, they were forced to retire.</p>
               <p>This repulſe, together with the intelligence of the hourly encreaſe of the forces in the Fort <hi>de la Pree,</hi> haſtned the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s raiſing the Siege, and his retreat to the <hi>Bay de l' Oye,</hi> to ſhip his men with more leaſure and ſecurity: On the eight of <hi>November</hi> early in the morning the Drums beat for their departure at noon, and ſcarcely was the Rear Guard got out of the Town, but the King's Army appeared much ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in Horſe, and equal to the others in Foot; having this fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:170346:81"/>
advantage, to purſue a retreating Army, and ſeize all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions which either the incommodity of the paſſes, or the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al diſorders that attend ſuch retreats might favour them with. At the paſs <hi>de la Coharde,</hi> they made as though they would have charged them, but obſerving the good order of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and the advantage they had of the ground, after a long halt, both Armies marched off, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> keeping the plain, and the King's Forces the Sea coaſt: Beyond this paſs was a hollow way, which croſſing the Marſh, extended it ſelf as far as the Bridge <hi>de l' Oye:</hi> At the entring of this the Squadrons began to be ſomewhat preſſed, and to ſtand upon their defence; but the Van, and then the Body being got into it, the Rear-guard, charged by the Marſhal <hi>Schomberg,</hi> was eaſily routed; in which defeat the <hi>Engliſh</hi> loſt ſeven or eight hundred men, but the night approaching, favoured their imbarquing of the reſt.</p>
               <p>In this action the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> committed two great errours; one was, The committing his retreat to the charge of fourſcore Horſe, which being forced in upon the Rear of their own Troops, broke, and confounded them; the other was, His omiſſion to raiſe a Fort, or ſome other defenceable work at the entry of that hollow way, where he had ſtill deſigned to make his retreat in caſe of neceſſity, which would abſolutely have ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it.</p>
               <p>At his departure, he aſſures the <hi>Rochellers</hi> of his ſpeedy return to their deliverance, with a more numerous and better fortified Fleet, alledging the inconvenience of the ſeaſon, and defect of proviſions, as the only cauſes that obliged him to draw off; and promiſing them a quick and abundant ſupply of all neceſſaries for a long defence; and further deſires ſome of their Merchants to follow him into <hi>England,</hi> that they might teſtifie the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of his affection and diligence, and that they might them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves carry back the effects of his promiſes. Nevertheleſs when he drew near the Coaſt of <hi>England,</hi> himſelf took a fly-boat, ſending the <hi>Rochelle</hi> Merchants to expect him at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> deſiring the Duke of <hi>Soubize</hi> to do the ſame at <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> where he would be as ſoon as he; and then ſteers his courſe towards <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> where the Earl of <hi>Holland's</hi> Fleet rode. When he came thither, he gave order that the ſhips that there lay ready, and laden with Corn for the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> ſhould be diſcharged, and the Proviſions ſold, upon pretence that they would be ſpoyled; which done he gets before to pre-poſſeſs the ſpirit of the King of great <hi>Britain,</hi> rejecting the blame of the errours committed in the expedition on thoſe were no way culpable; So that when

the Merchants came to exhibite their complaints againſt him, they were informed, it was the next way to make their condition worſe: And when they importuned him for a quick diſpatch of the proviſions for the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> uſed no other excuſe to anſwer their ſollicitations, than that they were ſold; and that which more amazed them, was his carrying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way three hundred Tun of Corn, which he might have left them, till they could have been better ſtored. But notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all this, the Merchans addreſſed themſelves to the King of <hi>England</hi> himſelf; to whom they repreſented their imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and the great preparations making to conſummate their ruine; imploring his Majeſty to favour them with a good and ſpeedy recruit of Victuals, that being the greateſt want that affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted them; which once ſupplied, there was nothing elſe which they much feared: But if their enemies had leaſure to block up their Port, their deſtruction was inevitable: All which the King anſwered with promiſes of a powerful and ſpeedy relief, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring them moreover, that he would hazard all the Forces of his Kingdom, rather than ſuffer them to periſh.</p>
               <p>While they expect the effect of theſe promiſes, the <hi>Rochel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> diſpatcht their Admiral <hi>Bragneau</hi> with money, and expreſs command to buy Corn, to lade both his own, and thoſe other ſhips they had already in <hi>England,</hi> and to return with it with all ſpeed: <hi>David,</hi> who was ſent after him, with the like Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, ſtores his ſhips with proviſions, and very happily got back with them into <hi>Rochelle:</hi> But <hi>Bragneau,</hi> inſtead of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Commiſſion, goes directly from <hi>Plymouth,</hi> where all things were ready for him, to <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> under colour of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing himſelf at a better rate; and yet inſtead of doing that, goes to <hi>London,</hi> where puft up with vanity derived from the promiſes of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> he minded nothing but an ambitious and covetous purſuit of the honour and profit of the Admiralty of the refugiated <hi>French,</hi> which at length he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, by the voluntary demiſſion of it, which the Duke of <hi>Soubize</hi> made of it, in favour of the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> and to eaſe them of the extraordinary expences they were at; and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, all the inſtant, and dayly ſollicitations made to him to that purpoſe, could not induce him to be gone, till the difficulties of the paſſage grew ſo great, that he was at laſt forced to wait the departure of the other Fleet preparing for their relief.</p>
               <p>This was the iſſue of this expedition of the Duke of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> in which he wracked both his own and his Countreys ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, conſumed much of the <hi>Rochellers</hi> proviſions, and ruined the party he came to relieve.</p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:170346:82"/>
               <p>The hopes this Victory gave the King of carrying the Town, made him more intent upon the Siege: The whole winter he ſpent in inveſting it by Land with Forts, Redoubts, and lines of Communication, and ſtraightning it at Sea by a Bar extending from the point of <hi>Coreilles</hi> to <hi>Fort Lewis,</hi> in which he ſpared nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther coſt nor pains.</p>
               <p>The Bonfires the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> made throughout the whole Country of <hi>Foix,</hi> gave the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> the firſt light of theſe misfortunes, the certainty of which was afterwards confirmed by an expreſs from the Duke of <hi>Soubize,</hi> who encouraged him ſtill with hopes that, the next Spring they ſhould return in a condition to wipe off the ſtains this affront had caſt upon them.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> received two ſeveral Advertiſements from the lower <hi>Languedoc;</hi> one was, that the Marqueſs <hi>de Portes,</hi> who had many confederates in the <hi>Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que</hi> of <hi>Saint Germain,</hi> having corrupted the Gariſon in the Caſtle of <hi>Florac,</hi> and gotten them to declare openly for him; <hi>Montredon,</hi> chief of the ſaid <hi>Colloque,</hi> haſted thither, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the whole Province to his aide, had beſieged the Caſtle, and in ſight of the Marqueſs <hi>de Portes,</hi> who was come with two thouſand men to relieve it, ſprung two Mines, ſtormed, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it to ſurrender: The other was, that the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> was coming down the <hi>Rhone</hi> towards the lower <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and that <hi>Briſon</hi> was in Treaty with him about the Province of <hi>Viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retz,</hi> which he ſought by all means to intimidate; urging the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi>'s abſence, and at ſo great a diſtance from them as an argument to inforce his deſign: This made him conſider that it was beſt to preſerve what they were already Maſters of; conceiving that if he wintered in <hi>Foix,</hi> he ſhould bring a famine on the Countrey, which had already had but a bad year, and was ſo little, and ſo remote from their other quarters, that if the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> on one hand, and the Duke <hi>d' Eſpernon</hi> on the other, ſhould joyn with the Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> he ſhould be blocked up on all ſides: That if he went to <hi>Montauban</hi> it would be to ſmall purpoſe, for that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were now gone, and the Winter was come on, and moreover that there was no poſſibility for him to return thence again; ſo that he conceived the ſecureſt way was, to return towards the lower <hi>Languedoc</hi> to oppoſe the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> there, and ſo preſerve that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
               <p>But before his departure, he convened the <hi>Colloque</hi> of <hi>Foix,</hi> ſettles <hi>Beaufort</hi> in the Government of it, to the great ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and joy of the Inhabitants; leaving with him his own Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:170346:83"/>
(which conſiſted yet of eight hundred men) and his own Troop of light Horſe-men; makes <hi>Rouſſeliere</hi> Governour of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verdun;</hi> took order for the fortifying of ſome places, of which there were three very conſiderable, to wit <hi>Mazeres, Saverdun,</hi> and <hi>Carlat;</hi> and as for the <hi>Mas d' Azil,</hi> the good fortune they had to withſtand the former Siege, gave them courage again to ſtand upon their defence.</p>
               <p>The only perplexity he had was for <hi>Pamiez,</hi> being a great Town, not fortifiable, nor well peopled of it ſelf; nor indeed were there enough of the Religion in all <hi>Foix</hi> to man it as it ought: The right courſe had been to diſmantle it; but Men, with whom in Warres of ſuch a nature a man muſt of neceſſity comply, are hardly perſwaded to things of that kinde: But although this remedy could not be applied, yet he prevailed ſo far upon the Inhabitants, as to fortifie a quarter of their Town called <hi>la Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadal,</hi> very conveniently ſeated, where he deſigned a handſom fortification; which done he appoints his General Rendez-vous at <hi>Mazeres,</hi> whence he marches by night, and returning the ſame way he went, comes to <hi>Revel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> having notice of his motion, goes to wait for him on the great Road to <hi>Montauban,</hi> whence he ſuddenly retired again to his quarters. The Duke goes from <hi>Revel,</hi> to the higher <hi>Languedoc,</hi> where re-aſſembling the <hi>Colloque</hi> he informed them of all he had done in <hi>Foix;</hi> encourages them to a conſtant perſeverance in their fidelity; and eſtabliſhes a Council for the direction of their affaires, untill ſuch time, as he could ſend them a Preſident for the <hi>Colloque,</hi> there being no man among them, that the reſt would give place to, for that the Marqueſs of <hi>Malauze</hi> who had been formerly their Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and would, without diſpute, have again been accepted of, was now wholly bent againſt their Party; the Court having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed ſo farre upon him, as to make him oppoſe the Duke of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han</hi> in that Province; which that he might the better do, he faines a deſire to be reconciled with him, which he ſignifies by Letter to <hi>Beaufort;</hi> and afterwards, at his firſt meeting with the Duke, diſcovering ſome diſpleaſure, that <hi>Caſtres</hi> was not yet joyned with the Party, proteſted that as ſoon as that Town, and <hi>Montauban,</hi> ſhould do ſo, and that a General Aſſembly was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, he would alſo publiquely declare for them. This had a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilent influence on the weaker ſort, and gave the diſ-affected among them, an opportunity to work much miſchief among the people; For neither the Declarations of <hi>Montauban</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtres,</hi> nor the convening of a general Aſſembly wrought any change at all in him, who continued ſtill an enemy to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed

Party; And diſpatches alſo <hi>Villemade</hi> to <hi>Montauban</hi> to inform them of the cauſe of his return, to perſwade them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, and to command the Souldiery, but in ſubordination to the Conſuls: But this laſt propoſition ſpoyled all the reſt; <hi>no man being eſteemed a Prophet in his own Countrey,</hi> ſo that they reſolved <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o aſſure themſelves of a Governour before they would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in the War.</p>
               <p>After this the Duke returns towards the <hi>Sevenes,</hi> and when he came to <hi>Vigan,</hi> received very urgent diſpatches from <hi>Viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retz,</hi> with intelligence that <hi>Briſon</hi> had quitted all the higher <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varetz,</hi> upon the approach of the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> (although for want of Canon, he was not in a capacity to force the moſt inconſiderable Fott there) who had burnt and pillaged that poor Countrey; and that, if they had not ſpeedy relief, it was to be feared that <hi>Privas,</hi> and the lower <hi>Vivaretz,</hi> would make their peace, to which <hi>Briſon</hi> earneſtly incited them; but upon notice of the Duke's return, and that he was coming in perſon to their relief, they re-aſſumed their courages, and maugre all <hi>Briſon</hi>'s diſſwaſions, reſolved to ſtand upon their guard; which obliged the Prince to paſs into the lower <hi>Languedoc;</hi> whither when the Duke alſo came, he met with ſome Souldiers of <hi>Niſmes,</hi> who had ſeized the Caſtle of <hi>Vauvert,</hi> which he cauſed them to quit, upon the advance of the Prince, who ſeemed to have an intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to beſiege it; unwilling to give him any occaſion to ſtop there, knowing that his orders were to paſs into the higher <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc,</hi> and that his ſtay would prejudice a deſign he had upon the Citadel of <hi>Montpellier,</hi> which <hi>Bretigny David,</hi> for ſix months together, had managed with the Baron <hi>de Meſlay,</hi> his Kinſman, and intimate friend; and eldeſt Captaine of the Regiment of <hi>Normandy,</hi> then in Gariſon in <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellier.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, foraſmmch as upon the arrival of <hi>de Foſſe,</hi> the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Normandy</hi> and <hi>Picardy</hi> were to be drawn out of the Town, and others to be placed there in their rooms; <hi>Meſlay</hi> who had there married one of the Religion, ſeemed much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented at this alteration; and that he had not left his own to embrace the Reformed Party: <hi>Bretigny,</hi> on the other ſide, who very well knew his ambition, cheriſhes him in this humour, and at length tells him, that if he could contrive a way to make himſelf Maſter of <hi>Montpellier,</hi> it would be then in his own power to make himſelf ſatisfaction, and that withal he would be received into a Party, from which, by that means, he might obtaine whatever his own wiſhes could ſuggeſt to his Hopes. The other liſtens to him, and demands time to conſider both of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:170346:84"/>
the thing, and the means to effect it, and both together con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived expedients for mutual Interviews, and conveying intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, without ſuſpition, one to the other. Not long after he tells him he was now reſolved to undertake the buſineſs; Treats with him concerning the advantages and conditions he expected from the Reformed Party, and ſhews him the way he had to make himſelf Maſter of the Citadel; to wit, that being on the Guard every fourth day with his own Company, he could, with much eaſe, let in as many as he pleaſed into it: That for aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his fidelity he would give his Wife in hoſtage; and when the deſign was to be put in execution he would advance an hundred paces from the Citadel towards <hi>Bretigny,</hi> to yield himſelf up into his hands.</p>
               <p>When all theſe things were communicated to the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> he very well liked of them, for that the two lines of Communication, which conjoyned the Town with the Citadel, being made, and the Town Wall that ſeparated them razed, as they were now at work upon it, the Town would not be able to defend it ſelf; but withal he declared that he would never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt this deſign, till that Wall were down, or, at leaſt, great breaches were made in it, that ſo one and the ſame action might put them in poſſeſſion both of Town and Citadel. The deſign thus concluded on, the Duke, for ſome dayes, deferres his march: But ſeeing they proceeded too ſlowly in raiſing the Walls, he departs, and advancing a little way from <hi>Roque-Courbe</hi> to paſs into <hi>Foix, Meſlay</hi> ſends <hi>Bretigny</hi> word, that the affaire was now in a very good poſture, and that it was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it ſhould be put in execution, before the Gariſon in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel was changed; Whereupon he is diſpatched into the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venes,</hi> and the lower <hi>Languedoc,</hi> with all neceſſary inſtructions tending to the executing of the deſign, and an expreſs charge particularly to impart it to <hi>Montredon,</hi> and to none elſe: But all was delayed till the arrival of the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> to whom they then made new Propoſitions, that, at the ſame time the Citadel ſhould be attempted without, he ſhould ſtorm the Town with two thouſand Men, and alſo ſcale the Walls of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, alledging, that when they ſhould be Maſters of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel, the time they muſt have to paſs three or four thouſand Men, through one gate, would give the Town too much leaſure to arm themſelves. This made him ſomewhat more cold in the buſineſs, and gave him great ſuſpicions of the treachery inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; whereupon he continued firm in his former reſolution; in ſo much as <hi>Bretigny</hi> complained that he found him ſo refractory in a buſineſs able to revive their drooping Party: But he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:170346:84"/>
to him the danger of this laſt propoſal, and that being once Maſter of the Citadel, nothing could hinder his taking of the Town alſo.</p>
               <p>While the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> was upon his March towards the higher <hi>Languedoc,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> Rallies his Forces, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing the Rendez-vous to be on the 19th. of <hi>January</hi> a little above <hi>Claret,</hi> five leagues from <hi>Montpellier;</hi> where about two of the clock in the Afternoon, there met ſix thouſand fighting men: Thence he ſent a party of Horſe to advance before the reſt of the Army, as far as the Bridge of <hi>Saleſon,</hi> which is about a league from <hi>Montpellier,</hi> to intercept all ſuch as might give any notice of his approach: And then commands <hi>Bretigny,</hi> chief of the enterpriſe, to march with the Van, conſiſting of fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Men, and divided into fix Squadrons; the three firſt were compoſed each one of thirty armed men, called out of the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntiers, and out of the beſt of the Cavalry, with Halberds and Piſtols; and of fourſcore others, half-Pikes, half-Muſquitiers; every ten armed Men had their Officer, and carried with them Petardes, and Ladders, to force the Court of Guard in the Citadel; and two great Forks to keep up the Portcullis; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther three Troops were compoſed of four hundred men, each one; and were ordered for a Reſerve to the other: After theſe, marched the Duke with his Men at Armes, followed by all the other Squadrons, the biggeſt of which conſiſted not of above four, or five hundred men. When they came to the Bridge of <hi>Saleſon,</hi> they found there the Baron <hi>de Meſlay</hi>'s <hi>Man,</hi> who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured <hi>Bretigny</hi> that all went well; whereupon, leaving all their Baggage on the other ſide of the Bridge of <hi>Saleſon,</hi> with a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Souldiers only to guard it, they advance as far as the Bridge called <hi>Juvenal,</hi> which is about a Canon ſhot from <hi>Montpellier: Bretigny,</hi> by a bold Souldier, gives notice of his arrival to his Couſin, who ſo well knew how to fool him, that he returned with an aſſurance that all was well, and in a good condition, and that there was no difficulty in the matter: Whereupon he proceeds, not minding at all what had been ſo often recommended to him, not to enter the place untill <hi>Meſlay</hi> was come forth to him, and had put himſelf into his hands; but his impatient deſire to execute ſo brave a deſign, animates him, without this precaution, to enter the Citadel with ſix or ſeven and thirty men; thoſe within not daring to let any more come in: For as ſoon, as they ſaw them plant their Forks to ſupport the Portcullis, they cut a cord, by which means the Bridge was drawn up, and a Trap-door opened, whence moſt of thoſe that were gotten in, fell down into a Trench, where they were all harque-buſiered, the Muſquitiers at the ſame
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:170346:85"/>
time playing on thoſe without; <hi>Montredon,</hi> who in <hi>Bretigny</hi>'s abſence was to command, and had received a charge to be at the Gate, and ſee them all enter in good order, drew off the Troops, and gave the Duke notice of their ſucceſs, who had drawn up his whole Body in Battaila on the right, and left hand of the great Road-way, which he had left open for the retreat of thoſe of the Van; who when they were all paſſed, he returned to the Bridge of <hi>Saleſon,</hi> where making an Halt, he Rallied his Men, and then drew off into the Plains between <hi>Montpellier,</hi> and <hi>Lunel,</hi> quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering his Men in the beſt Villages thereabouts; not any one ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out of <hi>Montpellier</hi> to purſue him, or obſerve his March. The next day he gave leave to the Troops, that came from the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venes</hi> to depart; and marched with thoſe of the lower <hi>Langue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc,</hi> to <hi>Saint Gilles,</hi> where he thought to have made an attempt upon that Garriſon, but the violence of the cold forced him to ſend his Men into quarters.</p>
               <p>This was the iſſue of that enterpriſe, in which <hi>Bretigny,</hi> and his brother were ſlain, with about twenty others, and ſixteen or ſeventeen more were taken priſoners.</p>
               <p>This Winter was the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> hardly preſſed both in the upper <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and in <hi>Vivaretz;</hi> in the former of which was the Prince of <hi>Condé;</hi> who whil'ſt he prepared to invade the Province by open force, endeavoured alſo by ſecret practices to undermine the conſtancy of thoſe Towns that had declared for the Reformed Party; ſo that the Duke of <hi>Rohans</hi> preſence there, with his Forces, was abſolutely neceſſary: And on the other ſide <hi>Vivaretz,</hi> ſince the Prince his March through it, was in a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable condition; the higher <hi>Vivaretz</hi> being loſt, with all that the Duke held upon the <hi>Rhone:</hi> And beſides all this, the Duke of <hi>Ventadour</hi> in his Seigniories, and <hi>Meſſargues</hi> in thoſe he held in right of his Wife, uſed extream cruelties, and violences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe of the Religion, ſeizing on their Eſtates, torturing their Bodies with Whips, and Baſtinadoes, driving them to Maſſe; ſo that there came thence, to the Duke, frequent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches, and Deputies, one upon the heels of another, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore his preſence, and the aſſiſtance of his Forces, to reſtore them to their liberty, which otherwiſe they ſhould be inforced to purchaſe at any rate; conſidering alſo the diviſions between all the Nobility of that Countrey, and <hi>Briſon;</hi> aſſuring him alſo that they had taken care for the quartering of his Troops, as long as their neceſſity ſhould require their ſtay there.</p>
               <p>There happened yet another accident, which much obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Voyage; to wit, the unexpected death of <hi>Briſon,</hi> which
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:170346:85"/>
much enlarged the former diviſions; for if the Nobility refuſed to ſubmit to <hi>Briſon,</hi> who had been already twice Governour of the Province, much more would they oppoſe his brother <hi>Chev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricles,</hi> a young man, of ſmall experience, and far ſhort of his brothers conduct to govern the Province: On the other ſide the faction of <hi>Briſon,</hi> which was the moſt prevalent in <hi>Privas,</hi> and <hi>Privas</hi> the moſt conſiderable place of all <hi>Vivaretz,</hi> choſe <hi>Chev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilles</hi> for their Governour; for that, being conſcious of his weakneſs, they thought to rule all more abſolutely, than under his brother, and to allow him what part they pleaſed, in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Affairs: To which muſt be added, that the Province of the lower <hi>Languedoc,</hi> which was to advance the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy-money, being highly intereſſed in the preſervation of <hi>Viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retz,</hi> and blocking up the <hi>Rhone,</hi> it being a River that with great facility and ſpeed could convey all ſorts of Arms, and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition to the enemy, preferred this deſign, before that of the higher <hi>Languedoc;</hi> for which place <hi>Rohan</hi> had raiſed two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments, of five hundred Men apiece, which was all they deſired, in caſe he could not come himſelf in perſon: But the untoward humour of <hi>Faucon,</hi> to ſay no worſe, much retarded this relief; for being deſigned for that expedition, after he had promiſed to go, and for that reaſon had received more Advance-money than was uſually allowed; he endeavoured to corrupt his Captains, that ſo he might reject his merited blame on them; but being not able to prevail on more than one, he was at length conſtrained to declare openly that he would not go at all; ſo that the Duke could ſend but eight of thoſe Companies with <hi>Caumette-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baud,</hi> who commanded the other Regiment: But by reaſon of theſe difficulties, protractions, and the artifices uſed by <hi>Faucon</hi> to withdraw both Officer, and Souldier from this Voyage, thoſe eight Companies could never amount to more than eight hundred men in the whole. The Duke thereupon cauſed <hi>Faucon</hi> to be ſecured, and tryed at a Councel of War, where he found more favour, than juſtice. 'Tis one of the greateſt calamities that attend the Generals of Parties poor, and compoſed of Volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries only, that they have no capacity either to reward the Noble, or puniſh degenerous and unworthy actions.</p>
               <p>But to return to the Voyage of <hi>Vivaretz:</hi> The Duke of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han</hi> raiſes four thouſand Foot, and about two hundred Horſe: But before he began his March thither, diſmantles <hi>Saint Geniez,</hi> and other ſmall places upon the River <hi>Gardon,</hi> within the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of <hi>Vſez,</hi> leſt the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> in his abſence, ſhould poſſeſs themſelves of them, and by ſmall Garriſons take off the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of all that Country which was full of good Towns; and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:170346:86"/>
prejudice the paſſage from the lower <hi>Languedoc</hi> to the <hi>Sevenes:</hi> And then engages the aforeſaid Provinces in a reſolution not to hearken to any particular Treaty, but to communicate all occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences to him, as on his ſide, he promiſed the like, and never to conſent to any without the privity of them, all the other Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>Rochelle,</hi> and the King of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When he had taken this courſe, he comes about the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>March,</hi> with all his Forces to <hi>Aletz,</hi> where he was ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited (even to a ſedition) by the Inhabitants, to employ his Forces in taking in of <hi>Vezenobre,</hi> and <hi>Monts,</hi> two Garriſons that incommoded them; but having cleared himſelf of this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, he advanced. His firſt work was to ſecure the Caſtle of <hi>Rouſſon,</hi> lying between <hi>Aletz,</hi> and <hi>Saint Ambroix;</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, in his March, takes in <hi>Tharque,</hi> and <hi>Saint John de Marne ſols,</hi> two places belonging to the Marqueſs <hi>de Portes,</hi> which yielded at ſight of his Canon; the latter of theſe he diſmantled, but not the former, being but a ſmall Caſtle, and the uſual reſidence of the ſaid Marqueſs: Having cleared his way as far as <hi>Bariac,</hi> and being now upon the Confines of <hi>Vivaretz,</hi> he thought it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſecure a Paſs upon the River <hi>Ardache,</hi> for the advantage both of his advance and return. To this end he beſieged the Caſtle of <hi>Salvas,</hi> ſituate on that River, which he blocked up with part of his Forces, whiles the other part, under the command of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bais,</hi> paſſed the River, both for the convenience of quarters, and proviſions, as alſo that at the ſame time he might block up the Caſtle of <hi>Valon</hi> alſo: The Siege of <hi>Salvas</hi> laſted five dayes; for that the Canon, and other neceſſaries, to force it ſuddenly, were not yet come up; ſo that they contented themſelves with breaking ſome of their Out-works, and then had recourſe to two Mines which they ſprung, and to good effect too; the baſe Court being taken, the Garriſon retreated to the Tower, which was ſtormed on every ſide: Thoſe within behaved themſelves brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, killed and wounded many of the Aſſailants, and among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the Colonel <hi>Goudin</hi> was hurt; but the Canon came up, and did ſuch execution on them, that they were conſtrained to yield the next day after the aſſault.</p>
               <p>Their example drew the Tower <hi>de Moulins,</hi> and the Caſtle of <hi>Valon</hi> alſo to a ſubmiſſion: The Duke cauſed the two Caſtles to be razed, preſerving only the Tower of <hi>Moulins,</hi> which of it ſelf was ſtrong, and tenable by a ſmall Garriſon. To ſecure this paſs, and clear all the way of <hi>Vivaretz,</hi> there remained only <hi>Ville-neufve de Berg,</hi> where the Governour <hi>Montreal</hi> had gotten together twelve hundred men; but notwithſtanding that, the Duke was reſolved, had it been poſſible, to attempt it; that
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:170346:86"/>
ſo he might not leave any thorns behinde him: But he wanted Ammunition, having ſpent his ſmall ſtore at the Siege of <hi>Salvas;</hi> where the ſcarcity of proviſions, and the nearneſs of ſome of his men to their own homes, had much diminiſhed his Forces; and, which was worſe, ſo little care had the Province taken in it, that there was nothing for them about <hi>Ville-neufve,</hi> ſo that he was fain to leave his Canon at <hi>Gorce,</hi> and for conveniency of quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to March with all his Troops to <hi>Privas,</hi> the Countrey ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not had the leaſt thought of any thing, but how to retort the blame of their want of Proviſions one upon another, ſo that he had much ado to keep together thoſe Souldiers he had left. The firſt exploit after his arrival in the Province of <hi>Vivaretz</hi> was the Siege of <hi>Choumerarg,</hi> performed by <hi>Chevrilles,</hi> and the Country Troops, whil'ſt his own refreſhed themſelves; it laſted three dayes, and then their Works being all battered, the place was yielded on the ſecond of <hi>April.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi>'s deſigns in <hi>Vivaretz,</hi> were to place a Governour, and to compoſe all the diviſions there; but principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſecure a good paſs upon the <hi>Rhone,</hi> both to draw the Tribute of the River to himſelf, and to facilitate the March of thoſe For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had promiſed him: For which end ſome propoſed to him <hi>Sojon,</hi> others <hi>la Voute,</hi> others <hi>Bajes,</hi> and <hi>Pouſin;</hi> the inconvenience of the firſt was its ſituation, being in the higher <hi>Vivaretz,</hi> and ſo remote from <hi>Privas,</hi> that it could not be eaſily removed from thence; that of the ſecond was, that it was a place belonging to the Duke of <hi>Ventadour,</hi> and being of it ſelf weak, and not capable to be made good, would drain <hi>Privas</hi> of all its Ammunition, and conſequently draw an affront upon that place, which would ruine his reputation, both with the adverſe Party, and his own too: Wherefore he pitches on the latter, and begins with <hi>Pouſin,</hi> which when <hi>Briſon</hi> gave it up, was diſmantled; but, to prevent our re-poſſeſſing of it, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my had fortified a ſmall Tower in the Caſtle, and raiſed a little Triangular Fort upon the Rivers ſide; he commanded <hi>Aubais</hi> by night, to poſſeſs himſelf of that part of the Suburbs which lies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Lauport;</hi> and <hi>Leques</hi> at the ſame time to enter the Town: In the mean time he drew his Canon, whereupon the Fort was given up; but chiefly for that <hi>Leques</hi> had already taken the Tower, and from the advantages of it, and the Caſtle, played ſo furiouſly into the Fort, that none durſt ſtir to ſhew himſelf in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chevrilles</hi> with the Forces of the Province, at the ſame time beſieges and takes <hi>Saint Aaban,</hi> which obſtructed the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage from <hi>Privas</hi> to <hi>Pouſin;</hi> and <hi>Malmoirac</hi> was commanded
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:170346:87"/>
to poſſeſs himſelf of the Town of <hi>Bajes,</hi> to ſecure it with Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricadoes, and ſeize on all the Boats in the Port, which he happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly effected: This done, <hi>Aubais</hi> received command to attempt the two Caſtles of <hi>Bajes,</hi> which after their diſmantling, had been again repaired; but upon the approach of the Canon, yielded: Which done, the Duke taking into his conſideration the ſituation of both places, conceived that of <hi>Pouſin</hi> to be the moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, both for the facility of being fortified, and the advantage it had to command the River; thither then he commanded to be brought all the Boats, and ſent <hi>Leques</hi> with twelve hundred men into <hi>Dauphine,</hi> which brought ſo great a terrour on them, that many Towns ſent him in voluntary contributions of Corn, Meal, and Bread, which was a great relief to his men, whom the avarice, and diſaffection of <hi>Privas</hi> had expoſed to great extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities; and, that he might loſe no time, ſets about the Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, to which the Countrey contributed ſo little, that he was fain to make Collections among his own Officers to pay the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that wrought in them.</p>
               <p>The Duke, during his abode here, ſollicites thoſe of the Religion in <hi>Dauphine</hi> to joyn with him; but in vain, the Count of <hi>Soiſſons</hi> amuſing them with hopes that he would ſhortly appear himſelf in the head of them; whereupon he ſent the Count ſome overtures to joyn with him, with four thouſand Foot, and three hundred Horſe in any part of <hi>Dauphine,</hi> he ſhould pleaſe to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point; and that if he would bring but as many, he would engage himſelf in a ſhort time to make him Maſter of the greateſt part of <hi>Dauphine;</hi> but he had no other return than empty words, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plementary thanks, which made him think that the Count had rather make an inglorious peace with thoſe he declared to be his enemies, than engage in an honourable War againſt them.</p>
               <p>Whil'ſt he ſtayed at <hi>Pouſin,</hi> he alſo received intelligence from the Duke of <hi>Soubize</hi> by <hi>Carlincas,</hi> that the Fleet deſigned to bring the Corn to <hi>Rochelle,</hi> would be there towards the latter end of <hi>May;</hi> but the other, from which they expected their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire deliverance, not till after the Harveſt. <hi>Chevrilles,</hi> who ſaw the ſtreights the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi>'s Forces were in, for want of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, propoſes him to an attempt upon <hi>Cheilard,</hi> a ſmall Town, belonging to the Duke of <hi>Ventadour,</hi> and ſeated upon the Confines of <hi>Vellay;</hi> It has large Suburbs, and a Caſtle, that commands them: All the Inhabitants of this, and the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring places, are of the Religion, and till now had been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely perſecuted by their Lord, even in times of peace; in order to the effecting of this deſign, he demands of him two Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which were granted him: The Town he took with Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tardes,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:170346:87"/>
and with the two aforeſaid Regiments inveſted a Caſtle, called <hi>La Chezé</hi> which is about a Canon-ſhot diſtant from <hi>Chei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lard,</hi> and upon the ſight of two Faucons that were drawn up to it, was given up; with theſe Gunnes he begins to play upon the Works of the Caſtle of <hi>Cheilard;</hi> but the Pieces being not ſufficient for Battery, he was fain to ſend to <hi>Privas</hi> for ſome bigger.</p>
               <p>During this Siege, the Duke had intelligence from all parts, of the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi>'s arrival in the higher <hi>Languedoc,</hi> who raiſed all the Forces he could to ſet upon him in his Marches, or to cut off his paſſage by taking <hi>Barjac:</hi> This newes made him reſolve, no longer to defer his return; wherefore he writes to <hi>Chevrilles,</hi> that in caſe the Caſtle of <hi>Cheilard</hi> was not taken by a day, which he prefixed, he ſhould ſend back the two Regiments; which ſo quickned his diligence in the enterpriſe, that the place was taken within the time limited him: And the Duke having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven order for the razing of all the places he had taken, except <hi>Pouſin;</hi> and left <hi>Chevrilles</hi> in a firm poſſeſſion of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſets out from <hi>Privas</hi> upon <hi>Eaſter</hi> day, and encamps that night below <hi>Mirabel;</hi> and as he was marching thence the next Morning by break of day, <hi>Aubais,</hi> that led the Van, informed him that the enemy appeared, both Horſe and Foot, about <hi>Saint Germain,</hi> a large Town, indifferently well fortified, and diſtant about a quarter of a league from <hi>Ville-neufve;</hi> whence they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo drew out freſh Souldiers: They were all the forces that <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadour</hi> and <hi>Montreall</hi> could make in that Countrey, which alarmed not the Duke at all, while he was employed about thoſe ſmall Sieges. They made choice of that place, as the moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous for them, the paſſage being ſtrait, and the Dukes For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of neceſſity to paſs within a Muſquet ſhot of the Town, the paſſages to which, were very commodious to lodge Muſquetiers in: But the Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> being half a dayes March ſhort of them, they only made a little skirmiſh, which made the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> deſirous to purſue them, and force the Town, which he might have done, but was happily diſſwaded from it, leſt the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> with his freſh Forces ſhould ſurprize him, while he was engaged, which would certainly have happened; for he came to <hi>Ville-neufve</hi> about two houres after they had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten over the paſs, which was done with very good conduct and order; in this Rencontre there were ſome ſlain, and wounded on both ſides: After this no enemy appeared; but the Duke when he came to <hi>Gorce,</hi> took his Canon, which he drew back to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duze,</hi> where he gave his Troops ſome refreſhment, which they ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much wanted.</p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:170346:88"/>
               <p>Mean while the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Montmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency</hi> joyning their Forces take the field, and march into <hi>Foix</hi> to attempt <hi>Pamiez,</hi> a great Town, but of no ſtrength: The ill deſtiny of <hi>Beaufort</hi> impelled him to a reſolution of defending it; to which end he calls in all his own, and moſt of the Forces of the Countrey; but, a breach being made, their confuſion was too great to give them leave to think of any further reſiſtance; thoſe that were falſe among them, uſing all means to augment the others fear: <hi>Beaufort</hi> ſeeing this diſorder, endeavoured to ſave himſelf by flight, together with <hi>Anros,</hi> but they were both taken, carried to <hi>Thoulouſe,</hi> and there put to death: The town was pillaged, and all manner of licentious cruelties imaginable from Souldiers under ſuch a Commander, were exerciſed in it: The taking of this Town much diſmayed the whole Countrey, where no place eſcaped the attempts either of threats, or promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; but the courage and fidelity of <hi>Rouſſeliere,</hi> whom the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> had made Governour of <hi>Saverdun,</hi> together with his ſedulous induſtry to encourage others preſerved the Province; and the Prince marched back, with his Army, into the upper <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc:</hi> Then was the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> fain to return to <hi>Vivaretz,</hi> to the aſſiſtance of his Partiſans there; and the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> was with no leſs inſtances ſollicited by the higher <hi>Langue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc,</hi> to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The Prince his firſt exploit was the Siege of <hi>Realmont,</hi> a Town whoſe ſituation rendred it very conſiderable; well ſtored with Souldiers, and all ſorts of Proviſions, and which might have held out much longer, and very well expected the relief preparing for it: But neither did he begin the ſiege, till he had Treated with <hi>Maugis</hi> who was Governour of it; who, having corrupted the firſt Conſul, the Colonel <hi>Chaumette,</hi> and his Sergeant Major, and made ſome ſhew of oppoſition for ten or twelve dayes, without any breach made, or conſulting with his Captains, or the people, contrary to the Oaths they were mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually engaged in, at the enemies firſt coming before it, not ſo much as to make the leaſt mention of ſurrendring, enters into a Capitulation, ſignes it, and preſents it to the Town; who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to approve of it, he lets in the Beſiegers at a Port, which was at his own devotion, whiles the reſt were every one at their reſpective poſts; ſo that great was the confuſion there, and though by the Capitulation the Defendants ought to have mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched off with their armes, yet was that violated, and they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed, <hi>Sigalon,</hi> and <hi>Huguet,</hi> two of <hi>Chaumett</hi>'s Captains, with ſome other honeſt Inhabitants of the place, maintained a <hi>Basti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> reſolutely declaring to the World, that they had rather dye
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:170346:88"/>
than quit their armes, which they carryed off, and with them as much honour due to their bravery, as the others did infamy, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited by their baſeneſs. Great were the miſeries of this poor Town, whence Men, and Women ſtript, and without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther covering than their diſchevelled haire, came to <hi>Roque-Courbe;</hi> where <hi>Saint Germier,</hi> and <hi>L' Espuguet,</hi> who had the conduct of the affairs of thoſe of the Reformed Party in thoſe parts, by means of the Correſpondents they had in <hi>Caſtres,</hi> made uſe of this Barbariſme to provoke the people to an Inſurrection, which had ſo proſperous an event, that notwithſtanding the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Preſident <hi>Montespieu,</hi> of the Advocate Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, the Conſuls, and their adherents, the Walls were ſcaled, and the Town without the effuſion of any blood taken, and the Preſident, and the Advocate baniſhed thence. <hi>Chavagnac</hi> at the ſame time came very opportunely into the Countrey, ſent thither by the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> to command in chief there, where he was received, and, even in <hi>Castres</hi> it ſelf, with an univerſal Joy.</p>
               <p>For beſides the delight all Novelties uſually bring with them, the preſent ſtate of affaires required a Governour; otherwiſe the Prince had carried all the Mountain of <hi>Albigeois</hi> before him; whereas now the greateſt miſchief ſuffered there was the loſs of <hi>Cauve,</hi> which the Marqueſs of <hi>Malauze</hi> cauſed to be delivered up to him, in which place, contrary to his promiſe, he left a Gariſon: After this he made an offer at <hi>Viane,</hi> blocked it up, and raiſed a battery againſt it; but ſeeing that neither his threats nor promiſes made any impreſſion on the Beſieged, and that the Governour <hi>Eſeroux,</hi> and <hi>Aſſas,</hi> whom the Duke of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han</hi> had ſent thither with four hundred men, ſeemed to be ſuch as would give him a ſmart oppoſition, he raiſed his ſiege; and thence goes to attempt <hi>Caſtelnau</hi> and <hi>Braſſac,</hi> places of no ſtrength, but ſurpriſeable even by unarmed men; Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the former gave him the trouble to draw down his Canon, where the obſtinacy of ſome, occaſioned the loſs of forty or fifty good Souldiers, who choſe rather to ſubmit to all extremities, than to obſerve the Orders given them by <hi>Chavagnac,</hi> to draw off as ſoon as they ſaw the Enemies Canon, which they might have eaſily done: This done, the Prince, not daring any more to look towards <hi>Viane,</hi> ſends <hi>Linas</hi> to <hi>Saint Sever,</hi> a place of which he himſelf was Lord, to perſwade the Inhabitants to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit before he drew down his Canon; but ſeeing how ineffectual all his perſwaſions proved, he ſtayes there with them; where, after they had endured many Volleys of Canon ſhot, themſelves made a breach in the Wall, and eſcaped by night. Thence he
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:170346:89"/>
goes to a Conference with the Duke <hi>d' Eſpernon,</hi> at which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved on the Siege of <hi>Saint Afrique.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But before we paſs into the higher <hi>Languedoc,</hi> it will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient that we ſpeak a word or two of <hi>Montauban:</hi> This Town, though it was then governed by Conſuls, and other Magiſtrates that were great Enemies to the Reformed Party, had neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs great inclinations to joyn with them: This, the Duke of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han</hi> himſelf at firſt hindred, being not willing they ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare before he came to them; and when after his return from the voyage of <hi>Foix,</hi> he deſired them ſo to do, nothing obſtructed it, but their want of a Governour: Whereupon the beſt part of the Town caſting their eyes upon <hi>Saint Michel,</hi> a younger bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>La Roche Chalais,</hi> and of Kin to the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> who applauded their choice, they received him into their Town about <hi>May,</hi> and there, after that <hi>de Bergues,</hi> and <hi>Saint Foy,</hi> through many difficulties, and great dangers, had conducted thither, from the lower <hi>Guienne,</hi> fourſcore, or an hundred Horſe, and <hi>Viant</hi> a Company of Foot, and that he had all his neceſſary Proviſions ready, on the four and twentieth day of <hi>June,</hi> they put him in poſſeſſion of his Command. The firſt thing he did, was to order all things in a Militiary way; raiſing a Regiment compoſed of Voluntiers, ſuch as had Aſyled themſelves there; and inrolling alſo in the eſtabliſhment, thoſe Horſe that <hi>de Bergues</hi> had brought thither.</p>
               <p>But before he could well ſettle himſelf in his authority he met with many rubbs, having for enemies, not only thoſe that were of a contrary Party, but, even among his own, many rivals for the place, who under-hand did him many ill Offices: Some of theſe he ſurmounted by prudence and diſſimulation; and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers he was fain to apply open force, and the extremity of rigor: The moſt eminent example of which, was occaſioned by three young Souldiers, Natives of the Town, whoſe names were <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tié, La Foreſt,</hi> and <hi>Brete,</hi> who diſguſted at a denial of ſome Offices they ſued fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; or elſe ſet on by ſome others, envious of his honour, entred into a conſpiracy againſt his perſon, and to compaſs their deſign make a Party in the Town, to which they drew in many Giddy braines, and among them ſome of quality, as the ſonnes of the Advocate <hi>Clerk,</hi> and the Counſellour <hi>de la Roſe,</hi> which gave greater ſuſpitions that this buſineſs was fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by other perſons, who, though they appeared not at all in it, yet were they the principal Agents. The pretence of this conjuration was the publique liberty, by which means having raiſed many of the people, they ſhew themſelves in the head of them, with their Swords and Piſtols in their hands, and in that
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:170346:89"/>
equipage march to the Governours quarters, crying out <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Liberty!</hi> and that it was high time to rid themſelves of thoſe that oppreſſed it: When they came near to his door, they were ſtopped by ſome of his guard, who ſo gallantly behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the defence of it, that they killed five or ſix of the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiniers, and among others <hi>Clerk,</hi> and <hi>La Roſſe:</hi> The tumult ſpreading it ſelf in the Town, the Conſuls, with a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Inhabitants, haſte down to the Governours; to whom when <hi>Saint Michel</hi> had recounted the Action, and juſtified the procedure of his Souldiers, all were well ſatisfied; and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls cauſing the ſaid <hi>Cartie, La Foreſt,</hi> and <hi>Brete,</hi> Authours of the ſedition to be apprehended, they were tryed, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Council of Warre, which in favour of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations in the Town, inſtead of hanging, cauſed them to be ſhot to death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saint Michel,</hi> whom this example of Juſtice had now fixed in his authority, thinks of enlarging his quarters; and conceiving himſelf ſtrong enough in Souldiers, by reaſon of thoſe that were fled thither for ſhelter, he undertook to put the Town of <hi>Cuaſade</hi> in a poſture of defence; and having put <hi>Chastillon</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Angoulmois</hi> with eight hundred good men into it, he uſed ſuch diligence in his fortifications, that in a very ſhort ſpace the place was made tenable; This the Prince, and the Duke <hi>d' Eſpernon</hi> had intended to beſiege, but were diverted by the Siege of <hi>Creſeil,</hi> which drew away the Prince with his Forces, ſo that the Duke <hi>d' Eſpernon</hi> was unwilling to engage alone in the Siege, but endeavoured to contrive ſome intelligences, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondencies within, that might help him to ſurprize it, in which even the Miniſter of that Church, whoſe name was <hi>Le Grand,</hi> who had deſerted it in the very beginning of the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, was his great Aſſiſtant, informing him of the condition of the Town, and perſwading him, as much as in him lay, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it; but finding his deſign not feiſible that way, he conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelf only with an aſſault, which he cauſed to be made on the out-works, where he was ſo generouſly received, that, leaving many dead upon the place, and ſome Gariſons in the adjacent Towns, he drew away again.</p>
               <p>But return we now to the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> who, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Siege of <hi>Realmont,</hi> was extreamly importuned to relieve it, for which he was diligently preparing himſelf; but after it was taken, he was as earneſtly ſollicited to march towards the higher <hi>Languedoc,</hi> ſo that there paſſed not a week in which he received not two or three diſpatches, to that effect: On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide he found he ſhould have much ado to gaine his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:170346:90"/>
conſent to it; for that their late ſufferings in <hi>Vivaretz</hi> gave them cauſe to fear they ſhould meet with no better entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this Voyage; ſo that to allure them to it, he reſolves on a deſign upon <hi>Mirveis,</hi> a place upon the Borders of <hi>Roüer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue,</hi> ſtrong, and of great concernment to the <hi>Sevenes,</hi> where he knew all the Countrey would come in to him; aſſuring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf withal, that, whatever his ſucceſs ſhould be in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, having by this means drawn his men half way, he ſhould with more facility perſwade them to adventure on the reſt.</p>
               <p>Wherefore he ſends for <hi>le Feſque,</hi> who firſt moved this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to him, and perſwaded him, that in taking the Town, he ſhould alſo ſurprize the Captain of the Caſtle, and at one ſtroke carry both: He gave him Orders to take as many Souldiers as he thought he ſhould have occaſion for; but at the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the execution of it, ſo violent and tempeſtuous was the weather upon the Mountain <hi>de l' Eſpernon,</hi> the place of Rendez-vous, that many of the Souldiers (though it was then Summer) died of the cold; ſo that they were faine to put it off till another time; which gave the enemy ſome jealouſie of their intentions, and thoſe in the Caſtle leaſure to furniſh themſelves with many neceſſaries, and eſpecially to recruit their gariſons with Souldiers: Notwithſtanding all which <hi>Le Feſque</hi> returnes thither again within two dayes, and fixing four Petardes to it, carried the Town: But, inſtead of preſently inveſting the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and ſecuring the Corn for the nouriſhment of the Army, every one fell a pillaging, and in the mean time the <hi>Chevalier Chamboux,</hi> with fifty men, got into it.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> in the mean time expecting the iſſue of this deſign at <hi>Niſmes,</hi> gave Orders for the raiſing of the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia of the <hi>Sevenes,</hi> and principally of the two Regiments of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſcure,</hi> and <hi>La Roque,</hi> and ſent away thoſe of <hi>Laſſayre,</hi> and <hi>Brenoux,</hi> commanding them by ſeveral wayes to march towards <hi>Mirveis,</hi> and, upon the firſt notice of the taking of the Town, to inveſt the Caſtle, and draw thither the ſmall Canon that was at <hi>Vigan:</hi> He ſent away alſo <hi>Goudin</hi>'s Regiment to <hi>Barjac,</hi> which the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> hovered about, as if he had ſome deſign upon it; with Orders alſo, in caſe neceſſity ſo required, to march into <hi>Vivaretz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This done; he receives advice of the taking of <hi>Mirveis,</hi> and the diſorders there committed: Whereupon he departs from <hi>Niſmes,</hi> and ſteering his courſe thitherward, ſent <hi>Leques</hi> poſt before him to compoſe and order all things there, When he came to <hi>Vigan,</hi> he met with a diſpatch from the higher <hi>Langue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc,</hi>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:170346:90"/>
preſſing him more inſtantly than ever to haſten thither, otherwiſe the whole Countrey was in danger to be loſt; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he ſent away <hi>Aubais</hi> with the Regiments of <hi>Sandres, Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquet,</hi> and <hi>Bimart,</hi> and three Troops of Horſe: When <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques</hi> came to <hi>Mirveis;</hi> conceiving, that that Caſtle was not to be forced by ſo mean a Train of Artillery as they had there, he commands the Canon to be drawn to <hi>Nujolls,</hi> to ſecure a Caſtle ſtanding upon a paſs of great importance, which upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of it preſently yielded.</p>
               <p>After this, comes the Duke himſelf to <hi>Mirveis,</hi> and being of opinion with <hi>Leques</hi> that there was no taking of the Caſtle without a bigger piece of battery: Thoſe that were at <hi>Millaud</hi> were propoſed, as the neareſt and moſt eaſie to be drawn thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Thither then he goes with a ſufficient Convoy for them, but found it abſolutely impoſſible to bring them; wherefore he commands <hi>Leques,</hi> by a Letter, to ſend with all ſpeed to <hi>Anduze</hi> for the Culverin of <hi>Niſmes;</hi> And in the interim determines to go himſelf to <hi>Saint Afrique,</hi> upon report of the Siege of <hi>Viane,</hi> which the Prince pretended to attempt; but as he was ready to ſet out, he received a Letter from <hi>Leques,</hi> which informed him, that upon a bruit ſpread among the Troops at <hi>Mirveis,</hi> that he was going towards <hi>Castres,</hi> and that there was a great relief preparing for the Caſtle, very many of the Souldiers had left their Colours, that the Inhabitants of the Town had ſent away their goods, and that unleſs his ſudden return thither pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented it, he would finde the Siege totally abandoned: This made him face about with all ſpeed; and finding that the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had written to <hi>Leques</hi> was fallen into the enemies hands, he ſent another to <hi>Anduze</hi> for the great Culverin; and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved now to ſee what would be the event of this Siege: In order to which he plants his Canon, and with them batters the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works that he might the more eaſily (in caſe there ſhould be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for it) come to mining; and as he was giving Orders to ſtorm the Caſtle-works the night following, there came Newes that there was a very conſiderable Body forming for the relief of <hi>Mirveis;</hi> that all <hi>Larzac</hi> and <hi>Roüergue</hi> flocked in to them; that there were twelve hundred drawn out of the Gariſon of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellier,</hi> and that from <hi>Beziers</hi> and <hi>Gignac,</hi> were ſent many Souldiers alſo; and that their Rendez-vous was to be at <hi>Veiros,</hi> two Leagues diſtant from <hi>Mirveis:</hi> In effect the thing was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true, and moreover the Baron <hi>Puzols,</hi> who commanded the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi>'s Life Guard, was already come thither with three hundred Horſe, to undertake the charge of the whole relief which conſiſted of about two thouſand Foot: This
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:170346:91"/>
made the Duke defer the ſtorming of the Caſtle, that he might provide to repel theſe ſuccours; to which end he ſpent all that night in cutting a Trench acroſs the hill, the only way they had to relieve the Caſtle, and cauſed his Canon to be drawn into a Redout; the next morning, the Majors General <hi>Leques</hi> and <hi>Boiſſiere,</hi> viſit all the quarters, cauſe the Redout, and Trenches to be well-manned, and Ammunition to be delivered out to the Souldiers, and alſo give all neceſſary inſtructions to the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels; the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> himſelf ſtayes in the Parade place with <hi>Montredon,</hi> the Voluntiers, two Troops of horſe-men, whom he had commanded to alight, his own Guards, and <hi>La Baume,</hi> with two hundred of his own Regiment, that he might be ready upon all occaſions, to ſend relief to thoſe that ſhould need it; about Noon the <hi>Scoutes</hi> give notice of the <hi>Romanists</hi> approach, and ſuddenly every one betakes him to his Poſt, when preſently after they ſhew themſelves upon thetop of a hill, whence they ſent down five hundred men in two diviſions, which advanced boldly, and in good order up to our very Canon, which gave them a very harſh ſalute; beſides which, they ſaw the Trenches well ſtored with men, and on the right, and left hand, Regiments marching up the Hill to environ them; this put them upon as ſudden and nimble a retreat; being followed with Vollies of Muſquet ſhot, up to the top of the Hill, where preſently all diſappeared, and by the diſorder was to be ſeen among them, might be rather conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to flie, than to retreat: The next day every one took his own way, and the Duke returned to the intended aſſault; battering, the night following, the <hi>Palliſadoes</hi> of the Counterſcarfe, all which were broken down; and then drew up to the very Graffe, from whence he bear the Defendants off their Works; who as he was approaching to the Wall, beat a parley, which they obtained, together with very honourable conditions. This Siege laſted three weeks; and when the Caſtle was delivered, there marched out one hundred and thirty Souldiers, that wanted neither Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor proviſion.</p>
               <p>When the Prince had notice of the reddition of <hi>Mirveis,</hi> and that the fifteen Companies drawn out of <hi>Montpellier,</hi> were upon their March to joyn with him, he reſolved with the Duke <hi>d' spernon,</hi> upon the Siege of <hi>Saint Afrique;</hi> which when the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> was informed of, he would have gone to <hi>Millaud;</hi> but the next day, after the reddition of <hi>Mirveis,</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he had no more than eight hundred men left, the reſt being gone to refreſh themſelves, he was forced to go to <hi>Vigan;</hi> after he had gotten an engagement from them, that within ten days they ſhould be all ready at any Rendezvous he ſhould appoint
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:170346:91"/>
them, to go to the relief of <hi>Saint Afrique;</hi> he ſent diſpatches alſo to <hi>Niſmes,</hi> and <hi>Vſez,</hi> from whence he received a very good recruit.</p>
               <p>In this interval, the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> had notice of what became of the ſecond Fleet, which was diſpatched from <hi>England,</hi> to ſupply <hi>Rochelle</hi> with proviſions, untill the greater, deſigned for its entire deliverance, could be made ready. The ſtory is this, The Duke of <hi>Soubize,</hi> ſeconded by the Deputies, and Merchants of <hi>Rochelle</hi> that were then in <hi>England,</hi> urges the King with ſuch earneſt and aſſiduous importunities, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved upon the victualling of <hi>Rochelle;</hi> for which, when all things were in a readineſs, the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> offered him the command of the Fleet; but underſtanding that there were but five men of War deſigned for their Convoy, and perceiving by ſo ſlender a proviſion of ſhips of war, that he intended to draw an affront, together with the whole blame of the <hi>Rochellers</hi> upon him, he refuſes to accept it, but declared withall, that, if he would go in perſon, he would be ready to accompany him; Upon this his refuſal, the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> re-inforces the Fleet with five great ſhips more, and many other men of War; and being raiſed to the number of ſeventy in all, on the 17th. day of <hi>May,</hi> he ſent them orders to hoiſe Sail, which they did under the command of his brother-in-Law, the Earle of <hi>Denbigh;</hi> ſoon as the enemy deſcryed them, they weigh Anchor, as if they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to advance, and fight them; but on the ſudden tacked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout again towards the ſame place from whence they came. <hi>Brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neau</hi> took a French Pinnace at <hi>Sablenceau,</hi> where the Earle caſt Anchor ſo near the Shore, that he thence received a Canon-ſhot into his own ſhip, which made him weigh Anchor again, and with the whole Navy remove to ride at a greater diſtance from the enemies Canon. Many dayes were ſpent in debates, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions never executed; ſo that ſome Merchants, that were there, urged him to attempt either to fight, or paſs by them; but his Captains ſtiffely maintained that it could not be done, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out expoſing the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces to too great a hazard; only the <hi>Vice-admiral,</hi> and one Capta in <hi>Carre,</hi> ſhewed more forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and loudly exclaimed againſt the flackneſs of all the reſt: Whereupon the <hi>French</hi> that were then in the Fleet, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of two or three and twenty ſhips, and <hi>Barques</hi> drew up together, and ſeeing the backwardneſs of the others to reſolve on any thing, come in a Body to the Earle of <hi>Denbigh,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent him a Petition ſigned by them all, by which they beſeeched him to grant them four Merchant-men fitted for a fight, three fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, and Souldiers to guard thoſe ſhips that carried the proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, obliging themſelves with that equipage to get into the town,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:170346:92"/>
and promiſing moreover, both in their own, and the names of the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> that in caſe any of thoſe ſhips miſcarried in the adventure, they ſhould be payed for, according to a juſt eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their value. But to all this they received no anſwer, but evaſions, and denials; whereupon the <hi>French</hi> ſent <hi>Gobert,</hi> to the King of great <hi>Britain,</hi> with their complaints, and withall, to diſcover to him the facility of the paſſage, and the offers they had made: Mean while the Captain <hi>Videau</hi> takes a ſmall Boat, and in it paſſes the <hi>Bay</hi> by night, carrying to the beſieged a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from <hi>Bragneau,</hi> which adviſed them not to rely any longer on hopes of relief from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who, at the ſame time, without any further attempt made, weighed Anchor, ſteering their courſe home-wards: When they came to the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> they caſt Anchor there, and thence ſent their Apologies into <hi>England</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, grounded upon the impoſſibility of the enterpriſe, and the tenour of their Commiſſion, whoſe moſt ſubſtantial words, and which imported a permiſſion to fight, they pretended were interlined, although it was with the Kings own hand.</p>
               <p>Theſe excuſes were eaſily admitted by the Duke, and thoſe of his Gang, though others deduced from them but ſad conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> that poor and miſerable people, that with ſuch tranſports of joy beheld the arrival of the Fleet, with no leſs aſtoniſhment ſaw it lie idle for eight dayes entire, and then leave them in a greater dejection than before; and yet having received ſo many promiſes, and aſſurances of relief, could they not give credit to their Admirals Letter, but prepare a new diſpatch to the King of <hi>England;</hi> who upon the newes of the Fleets return, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles his Council, and reſolves to ſend back <hi>Gobert</hi> to the Earle of <hi>Denbigh</hi> with new Orders to return again to the Rode of <hi>Rochelle,</hi> and there to expect a Renfort. About which time alſo came <hi>Bragneau</hi> with newes of the Fleets return, and two dayes after <hi>Clarke,</hi> who was ſent to be of the Earles Councel, and Agent for the King in <hi>Rochelle,</hi> who when he had given in his relation of the affair, had his own houſe for his priſon: But to haſten away this new relief for the diſtreſſed <hi>Rochellers,</hi> Orders were given to Captain <hi>Manners,</hi> &amp; Captain <hi>Pennington,</hi> to expedite the building of ten great ſhips, of fifteen hundred, or two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Tun-burthen, made purpoſely to fight near the ſhore, not drawing more than ſeven or eight foot-water, and carrying two and twenty Guns a piece: The Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who deſired not that any one ſhould pry too narrowly into the projects he had againſt <hi>Rochelle,</hi> removed from the Court a Secretary that was very zealous for its deliverance, cauſing him to be ſent to <hi>Portſmouth</hi> to prepare other Veſſels, and buy Proviſions, and Ammunition there, where he ſtayed till the departure of the Fleet.</p>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:170346:92"/>
               <p>But let us now ſee what paſſed at the Siege of <hi>Saint Afrique,</hi> a ſmall Town, lying between two hills that command it, ſo that nothing can be done within, that may not from thence be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; neither did any till this time, ever think of fortifying it: But yet the importance of the place for preſerving the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication between the higher, and the lower <hi>Languedoc</hi> obliged us to break the ground, which is there very maniable: But never did that Town expect the honour of an aſſault from the firſt Prince of the blood: The River <hi>Sorgue</hi> runs under the walls of it, and divides it from that part of the Suburbs, that lies towards <hi>Vabre,</hi> which of neceſſity was to be fortified alſo, it being eaſie for the enemy to make his approaches that way, and for that the River beating againſt the Walls, would not give way to any nearer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications on that ſide: The whole fortification of this Suburbs was compoſed of Spurs, and little Flanquers, whoſe Trenches were four fathom wide, and the Parapet Canon-proof, behind it was nothing but a ſmall bank inſtead of a Rampart; all that gave us hopes to be able to defend it, was, that there was room enough for us to intrench our ſelves behind it; beſides, ſo ſtrangely odde was the ſituation of that place, that without a great Army, there was no hindering of relief from coming to it, both from <hi>Millaud, Saint Rome, Tarn,</hi> and the Bridge of <hi>Cauvers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anbais,</hi> who was advanced as far as the ſaid Bridge, that he might have an eye upon <hi>Viane,</hi> when he ſaw the Army bind its courſe towards <hi>Roüergue,</hi> divided his Forces into two parts, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the ſtronger to himſelf, and ſending the other to <hi>Saint Afrique,</hi> which the Prince came before on the eight and twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth day of <hi>May;</hi> and having viewed it, conceived it intenable, and at that inſtant condemned it to the fire, and all manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities; nor yet indeed was it to be defended, but by a great number of men: <hi>Aubais</hi> very handſomly did his devoir, ſending them from his quarters, as many men, and as much powder as they deſired: <hi>La Baume,</hi> whom the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> had left with his Regiment at <hi>Millaud,</hi> for the ſame purpoſe did the like; ſo that in the very height of the Siege, there was no want of any thing; but there happening a difference between <hi>Vacareſſe,</hi> and <hi>Bimart, Saint Eſtienne,</hi> and <hi>Sandres</hi> were fain to interpoſe, and reconcile them, who afterwards did very good ſervice in the ſtorm. The approaches, batteries, and breaches, being all made with in the ſpace of eight or ten dayes, the Prince com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands his men to make ready for the aſſault, and thoſe within al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo prepare to give him a brave reception; who, though they had very good Works and Trenches, would not yet loſe one inch of ground: There were within the Town, beſides the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:170346:93"/>
Foot, the Baron <hi>d' Aletz,</hi> and <hi>Saint Eſtienne</hi>'s Troops of horſe; the beſt armed among them were placed at the Breaches, and all the other poſts were well manned alſo: The whole Garriſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of fifteen hundred fighting men; the ſtorm laſted five houres, was thrice renewed, and during it, one <hi>Culverin</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged about ſixty ſhot upon one of the Breaches, which carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off ſome legs, and armes; but could not ſave the Aſſailants from a repulſe, who left four hundred dead upon the place, among which were <hi>La Paſſe,</hi> and <hi>La Magdaline,</hi> two Captains, and fourty other Officers, not compriſing thoſe that were wounded; of the Defendants there were flain about eight and twenty, and threeſcore hurt.</p>
               <p>The morrow after the aſſault was made, came both from <hi>Millaud,</hi> and the Bridge <hi>de Cauvers,</hi> four hundred men more to <hi>Saint Afrique:</hi> The news of this quickly flew to the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> at <hi>Mirveis,</hi> where he had three thouſand Foot, and made what haſt he could thither; having given order that <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagnac,</hi> with the Forces of <hi>Albigeois,</hi> ſhould joyn with <hi>Aubais,</hi> and fall upon the enemy on one ſide, while he did the like on the other; and the beſieged, at the ſame time, were to make a ſally upon their Canon: But that which he feared, came to paſs, to wit, the Prince his raiſing the Siege: Then had the Duke a fair opportunity to purſue him, and then thought of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that would prevent it: But the affairs of <hi>Caſtres</hi> ſummoned him thither, where <hi>Saint Germier,</hi> induced to it, by thoſe that were diſaffected to the Reformed party, oppoſed <hi>Chavagnac</hi> in his command: Thoſe of <hi>Foix</hi> required his preſence, to remedy the diſorders fallen out there ſince the death of <hi>Beauſort;</hi> the Town of <hi>Villaude</hi> would by all means that he ſhould ſit down before <hi>Creſſeil,</hi> and ſent Deputies purpoſely to ſollicite him to to that effect; and on the other ſide, the Siege of <hi>Saint Afrique</hi> being now over, no body would ſtir a foot further; all alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the neceſſity of their return, to look after their Harveſts, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially thoſe of <hi>Niſmes,</hi> and <hi>Vſez,</hi> whoſe fields were threatned to be ravaged; and beſides theſe, there were in the Army many Citizens, and Merchants, too delicate, long to endure the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of an Army: <hi>Vivaretz</hi> alſo cryed out for help, the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> being fallen into that Province, with a ſtrong power: <hi>Lyonnois</hi> alſo with <hi>Dauphiné, Vivaretz,</hi> and the lower <hi>Languedoc,</hi> importuned him to free the <hi>Rhone;</hi> on which the Duke had already beſieged <hi>Pouſin,</hi> and battered <hi>Mirabel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Amidſt theſe urgent follicitations on all hands, the Duke, it being impoſſible for him to divide himſelf amongſt them all, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to the lower <hi>Languedoc;</hi> ſends <hi>Aubais</hi> to <hi>Caſtres,</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe

               <p>This Siege wrought the wiſhed effect; for the Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> after he had taken <hi>Mirabel,</hi> inſtead of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his progreſs in <hi>Vivaretz,</hi> marched off to relief <hi>Vezenobre,</hi> which he thought would have held out much longer; but finding the buſineſs all eady over, he drew off to <hi>Beaucaire;</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> when he had given order for ſlighting of <hi>Veze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobre,</hi> diſmiſſed his Voluntiers, put his other Regiments into Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons, and goes himſelf to <hi>Niſmes,</hi> to put them in a poſture to prevent the ſpoil the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> had command to make there; but had written to the Court, that he could not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake it with leſs than ſix thouſand Foot, and five hundred Horſe; for which care was taken, and he ſupplied with three Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments from <hi>Dauphine,</hi> and ſome Horſe drawen out of the Army, the Marqueſs of <hi>Vxelles</hi> was then conducting to the relief of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zal:</hi> Theſe preparations made <hi>Niſmes,</hi> and <hi>Vſez</hi> look about them, and promiſe good quarters to all the Horſe and Foot ſhould come in to their aſſiſtanee: The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> writ to thoſe of the <hi>Sevenes,</hi> to this effect; but they came not ſo ſoon as they promiſed; nor did thoſe of <hi>Niſmes</hi> gratifie them as they ought; Nevertheleſs he goes to ſee what might be done, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to preſerve all their Corn, within a League of their Town, to wit, that which lies upon the <hi>Viſtre</hi> (which is the richeſt land about <hi>Niſmes</hi>) a ſmall, but dangerous River; all whoſe paſſes he ſpoyles, and in all places of danger cauſed good Redoubts to be built; but as for the reſt of their Fields, there was no poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of preſerving them: And yet, had the Peaſants obſerved what was commanded them, which was, to leave their Sheaves ſcattered upon the ground, they had ſaved a great part of them; which being made up in ſtacks, and the enemy coming to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage at the time they uſually threſh out their Corn, (which is there done in the Fields) they were all eaſily conſumed.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> takes up his firſt quarters at <hi>Saint Margueriete,</hi> a good league from <hi>Niſmes;</hi> and the next day lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it on his left hand, came and lodged at <hi>Chaumette,</hi> and <hi>Saint Genies,</hi> three leagues diſtant from <hi>Niſmes,</hi> and as farre from <hi>Vſez:</hi> Thence paſſes through the Towns upon

               <p>About this time came a Gentleman from the King of <hi>England</hi> to the Duke, which diſpatch was occaſioned by an apprehenſion given him, that ſince the return of the ſecond Fleet, there were two Deputies with the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> in order to a Treaty for peace; to divert which, he was commanded to tell him, that though that Fleet after an ineffectual Voyage were returned, yet there was now ſo ſtrong a one prepared, and ready to ſet Saile, that he was confident it would be the entire deliverance of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelle;</hi> and that though God ſhould not favour him in that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, yet would he never forſake the reſt of the Reformed Party; Nay, although there ſhould be no more left than the very perſon of the Duke, he aſſured him he would hazard all that he was Maſter of, for the preſervation of that alone; deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring further to know of him what hopes he had of aſſiſtance from <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> that in caſe the King ſhould preſs him too hard, he might be directed by him how to aſſiſt him, either by a diverſion or otherwiſe: <hi>David,</hi> one of the Deputies of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelle</hi> was preſent at the delivery of this Meſſage: To which the Duke replied, that he was ſo far from any thoughts of a Treaty, that he had again cauſed the Oath of Union to be renewed, to this effect, that none ſhould hearken to any peace, but conjoyntly with him; and that he had already made known to him, the means he had to aſſiſt him.</p>
               <p>This done, the Duke ſeeing the Duke of <hi>Monmorency</hi>'s Troops lay ſcattered and diſperſed in ſeveral parts, takes his turn alſo, and burnt all the Corn, and Countrey Houſes belonging to the Inhabitants of <hi>Beaucaire,</hi> within Muſquet ſhot of their very walls: And when he thought to make another inrode into the <hi>Mariſh-Countrey</hi> for Salt, he met, in a narrow place upon the <hi>Rhone,</hi> nearer home, two Barques convoyed by a Frigote, and laden with four and twenty thouſand <hi>French</hi> Buſhels, ſo that commanding ſome of his Souldiers to ſwim to the other ſide for a Boat, he tranſported many of his Foot to <hi>Camargues,</hi> that he might on both ſides attaque the Frigote; but ſhe ſoon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook her Merchandize, which was as quickly carried away: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:170346:94"/>
this booty, they drove much Cattle from <hi>Camargues,</hi> and did much ſpoyle there alſo by fire. When the Duke of <hi>Montmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency</hi> heard of theſe excurſions, he made haſte to rally his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, appointing them their Rendez-vous at <hi>Lunel.</hi> The Duke, in this expedition, going, and returning, marched above four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen long Leagues, without making any long ſtay in any place; and got home again before any of the enemy could be gotten together; And happy was it for him; for he was but in an ill condition to fight; every Souldier being ſo laden with pillage, that he could never get any more to march in order, than three hundred ſouldiers, of <hi>la Baume</hi>'s Regiment, which brought up the Rear.</p>
               <p>When this expedition was over, the Duke was in great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities, not knowing how to diſpoſe of his Forces, eſpecially his Horſe: For he could now raiſe no more contribution for their maintenance, by reaſon that the Villages were all burnt: And the <hi>Sevenes</hi> was no Countrey for Horſe: If he ſhould go towards <hi>Castres,</hi> there was the Prince with his Army in the higher <hi>Languedoc,</hi> who had particular Orders to impede his paſſage; and the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> had alſo a ſtrict Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, with his Forces to follow him, whither ever he ſhould go: For it was feared leſt he ſhould go to <hi>Montauban,</hi> and raiſe thoſe of the Religion in <hi>Guienne</hi> in favour of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> whoſe coming they feared: If he went into <hi>Rouergue</hi> to no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end but to eat them up, it would not be long ere their cryes would be heard; ſo that neceſſity now obliged him to undertake the ſiege of <hi>Creſeil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But before we go thither, it will not be amiſs to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of <hi>Aubais</hi> his return to <hi>Caſtres;</hi> who though he made but a ſeeming accommodation between <hi>Saint Germier</hi> and <hi>Chavag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nac,</hi> the cauſe of the miſunderſtanding ſtill remaining, and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting their conceived rancour one againſt the other, ſo that the pretended reconciliation laſted not long; nevertheleſs his being there was to great purpoſe to oppoſe thoſe that came to forrage and plunder thoſe parts, where his brother <hi>Saint Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne</hi> was unhappily ſlain, by their own Canon, which being not well ſpunged, as they were re-charging it, the Powder took fire, and killed him: He was a Gentleman of great courage, and zeal for his party, and was the next day to have gone into <hi>Foix,</hi> where they ſtood in great need of him.</p>
               <p>The Marqueſs of <hi>Ragny,</hi> who commanded the Prince his Army, and had much ravaged the Countrey, goes, for his laſt exploit, to burn <hi>Mazamet,</hi> and to beſiege <hi>Hautpont,</hi> whither <hi>Dupuy,</hi> a gallant Souldier, with the Inhabitants of <hi>Mazamet,</hi>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:170346:95"/>
were retired; but having, to no purpoſe, lain before it for the ſpace of twelve dayes, he drew off to <hi>Brugiere,</hi> where he dyed.</p>
               <p>And here it will be expedient to inſert a word or two concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Clauſel,</hi> who coming from <hi>Piedmont,</hi> made the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> ſome propoſitions of aſſiſtance from <hi>Spaine;</hi> which, if de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, he was confident he might have freely, and in a large meaſure; for that having conferred about it with the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> he had given him very good hopes of it; telling him moreover, that it was the Intereſt of <hi>Spaine,</hi> to endeavour a prolongation of the Civil Wars in <hi>France;</hi> that they might with more eaſe compaſs their deſigns in <hi>Italy;</hi> that the Abbot <hi>Scaglia,</hi> the Dake of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s Embaſſadour, was now in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and would contribute his utmoſt power to aſſiſt him in it; having already in <hi>England,</hi> and elſewhere, declared himſelf a great favourer of the Reformed Party, out of his implacable hatred to thoſe that govern now in <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The great exigencies the Duke was in for want of money, the Countrey being unable, aad the Towns unwilling to furniſh him any more; neither could he expect any from <hi>England;</hi> nor had he received any thing from the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> but empty promiſes, enforced him to ſeek out ſome way or other to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply his wants; and in effect he ſaw none but this; which yet he durſt not pitch upon, without the King of <hi>England</hi>'s leave, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leſt it might give him an offence, and conſequently an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to deſert him: Notwithſtanding this doubt, yet would he not reject <hi>Clauſel</hi>'s propoſals; but deferres his diſpatch, till he could give notice of it to the King of <hi>England,</hi> and to his Embaſſadour then in <hi>Piedmont;</hi> from both whom he received very favourable anſwers; and then ſent <hi>Clauſel</hi> into <hi>Spaine;</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning him to declare to the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> that if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the War in <hi>France</hi> might be ſerviceable to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, upon condition he would afford thoſe of the Religion a ſpeedy and round ſupply of money, he would engage himſelf to protect it, as long as it ſhould be agreed upon between them; but that otherwiſe he ſhould be conſtrained to make his peace; that he ſhould have the whole Winter to provide it, and that he would expect his anſwer till the next March: And foraſmuch as that, immediately after the departure of <hi>Clauſel,</hi> there came news of the loſs of <hi>Rochelle;</hi> he ſent two Meſſengers after him to let him know, that that accident had not any thing ſhaken his reſolutions; but that he continued conſtant to his former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals. <hi>Clauſel</hi> paſſes through <hi>Foix</hi> into <hi>Spaine,</hi> where he was very well received, and heard; and had very advantageous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:170346:95"/>
made him alſo; All which good news he imparts to the Duke of <hi>Rohan;</hi> giving him good hopes of a prompt, and powerful aſſiſtance: At length having concluded the Treaty, he goes into <hi>Piedmont,</hi> to facilitate and expedite the execution of all things; and as he went, landed a Gentleman belonging to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who was to have brought the Duke a Copy of the Agreement; But he ſuffered himſelf to be taken at the Gates of <hi>Lunel,</hi> when he had but half a League more to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all danger, of which <hi>Rohan</hi> advertiſed <hi>Clauſel,</hi> who when he came to <hi>Piedmont,</hi> gave the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Embaſſadour an account of all his negotiation.</p>
               <p>Return we now to <hi>Creſeil,</hi> a place about a Canon ſhot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from <hi>Millaud,</hi> having a treble incloſure of Walls, one whereof environs the Town, and the two others the Caſtle, which muſt be forced one after another, for that there is no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming at the Caſtle, but through the Town; the fartheſt part of it being built upon a Rock of a vaſt height: It is true, the Walls that incloſe the Town are not worth any thing, being ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inous, and full of breaches, ſo that it were a ſhame to lie eight dayes before it, and not to take it: But he that has to deale with a people, to whom no deſign ſeems difficult, and when they come to put it in execution, make no proviſion of neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to effect it, will want no incumbrances: <hi>Rohan</hi> gives no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his intentions to <hi>Alteyrac</hi> and <hi>Guerin,</hi> that without any noiſe, they might put all things in a readineſs to effect them; and gave <hi>Alteyrac</hi> alſo Orders to block up the place, a day before he came with his Troops; that ſo he might ſurprize it at a greater advantage, when meanly furniſhed with Souldiers; which he did, but yet all their diligence could not prevent the entry of ſupplies into it.</p>
               <p>When the Troops were all come up, the Siege was formed, and a battery of two Guns raiſed, which had not diſcharged ſix ſhot, before the Carriage of one of them flew all to pieces; and when that was mended, the like accident befell the other; ſo that the whole time, almoſt, was ſpent in repairing the Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages of the Guns; and with ſuch untoward Timber, that when all was done, they did but little better than before; ſo that the breach being not made large enough in one day, they were fain to remit the proſecution of their battery till the morrow, which gave the beſieged leaſure to repaire, and make it better than before: Nevertheleſs urged by the ſhortneſs of his time, the Duke commanded an aſſault to be made, in which he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed. In the mean while the Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> who with his Army, had ſtill waited on the motions of <hi>Rohan,</hi> joynes
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:170346:96"/>
with the Prince; and having diſſwaded him from his intended attempt upon <hi>Cauſade,</hi> and gotten together all the Forces of that Countrey, came with eight thouſand Foot, and ſix hundred Horſe to lie at <hi>Saint Geo ges,</hi> diſtant but a league from <hi>Creſeil;</hi> of which, when the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> had intelligence, that very night he drew off his Canon, and the next day, having left <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeil</hi> again at liberty, drew up his whole Army in Battailla near <hi>Millaud;</hi> where about noon, the Prince appeared with his whole Army, which, when <hi>Montmorency</hi> had recruited the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon with men, and all other neceſſaries, marched off to their quarters.</p>
               <p>This Siege did at leaſt this good, that it preſerved <hi>Cauſade,</hi> which was not yet in a condition to withſtand ſo great a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: The night following <hi>Rohan</hi> ſends his Foot into <hi>Saint Rome</hi> upon <hi>Tarn,</hi> and into <hi>Saint Afrique;</hi> and ſeeing that both Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were ſo near him, he thought with his Cavalry, having no baggage to incumber them, he might reach <hi>Castres</hi> in one night: This he propoſed to his Officers, who were of opinion, that it would be convenient to ſtay one day longer, to obſerve the countenance of the enemy, which totally fruſtrated his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of paſſing that way; for as he was about to attempt it the next day, he found that <hi>Montmorency</hi> had prevented him, and waited for him on the way both with Horſe and Foot; which made him inſtantly reſolve to take with him all his Forces, and by great Marches got into the higher <hi>Languedoc,</hi> to beſiege <hi>Aimargues,</hi> which he was confident (in caſe he found but the ordinary Garriſon in it) a few dayes would make him Maſter of; It is a Town of an indifferent bigneſs, diſtant about four leagues from <hi>Niſmes,</hi> and one from <hi>Lunel,</hi> ſeated in the beſt part of that Countrey, and upon a Flat, no wayes to be commanded, the mold alſo being ſoft, and tractable; and in ſhort, accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with all things neceſſary to make it a very brave place; it is alſo incloſed with fair Free-ſtone Walls, flanked with ſmall Towers, and a large and deep Trench, full of water, on the outſide of which were two or three half Moons, little, and ill made. To this end he ſent <hi>Aubais</hi> to <hi>Niſmes,</hi> to get the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non in a readineſs, and that he might the better conceal his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, divides his Forces, and marches thither two ſeveral ways; he himſelf, with that party which he conducted, came thither firſt, and preſently inveſts the place; the next day arrived the others alſo, and then he aſſigned every one their poſt, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely blocked it up: And without further delay ſent to <hi>Niſmes,</hi> to haſten away the Canon, which came alſo in good time: The night following, he plants them upon the Battery he had raiſed,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:170346:96"/>
and the next day, without the loſs of one man, made a fair breach; and having made proviſion of ladders, for that the Walls, being but low in many places, are eaſily ſcalable, and the Trench in many parts paſſeable, he diſpoſed his men for a general aſſault: When the Governour, the Marqueſs of <hi>Saint Sulpice,</hi> a younger brother of the houſe of <hi>Vſez</hi> ſaw theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, conceiving he had not men enough to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt the ſtorm, he demands a parley; the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> ſent him word, that he was much troubled that a young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of his quality ſhould be ſo unfortunately engaged in a place where from his firſt Eſſay he could derive nothing but diſadvantage and diſhonour: Nevertheleſs out of regard to the amity between their houſes, he offered him as honourable conditions, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf could have deſired, which he accepted, and within an houre after marched out with his Garriſon.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> while he was yet at <hi>la Caune,</hi> at the ſame inſtant received intelligence, both of the Seige, and taking of this place, and upon the re-iterated importunities made him, preſently repaired thither to ſettle the Province, which the ſo ſudden taking of <hi>Aimargues</hi> had much diſordered. The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> mean while employes that little leaſure he had in clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Countrey of thoſe Paltry Forts, and Towns, which lay about <hi>Niſmes,</hi> and <hi>Vſez;</hi> as the Caſtle of <hi>Vauvert, Mainne, Sargnac, Saint Bonnet, Reſmolins, Ves,</hi> and <hi>Chastillon,</hi> which yeilded upon the approach of his Canon: All which he demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, except <hi>Reſmolins,</hi> which he was deſirous to keep for that it might be uſeful to him when he ſhould have occaſion to look towards <hi>Ville-neufive</hi> by <hi>Avignon:</hi> But the conſervation of <hi>Aimargues,</hi> and the Fortifications he had there begun, made him relinquiſh all other deſigns for the preſent, to apply himſelf whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to that.</p>
               <p>Whiles he was thus occupied, ſurvenes the Duke of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morency,</hi> threatning to beſiege <hi>Aimargues,</hi> and preparing his Canon, and all other neceſſaries for it; which obliged the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> to draw towards it, and clap in twelve hundred Foot, where he deſigned alſo a Counterſcarfe, Curtains, and half Moons, to be made for the ſecurity of thoſe places which were weakeſt, and moſt liable to danger; and having ſummoned in the Militia of the <hi>Sevenes,</hi> he put ſix or ſeven hundred of them into the great <hi>Galargues,</hi> whither he cauſed ammunition-bread to be ſent them daily from <hi>Niſmes,</hi> commanding them to defend it againſt a party, but not to ſtay till the enemy drew down their Canon. Some weeks paſſed they in this poſture; in the mean time the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> deſpairing to do any good upon
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:170346:97"/>
                  <hi>Aimargues,</hi> turns his deſign upon the Forces in <hi>Galargues;</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points his Rendez-vous by break of day at the Bridge of <hi>Lunel,</hi> and that morning goes thence to inveſt them. The two that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded there, were <hi>Valeſcure,</hi> and <hi>la Roque,</hi> both gallant Gentlemen, the former very ſtiffely perſiſts in a reſolution to ſee their Canon, thinking by night, to draw off into <hi>Vauvage,</hi> a good Countrey for the Foot, and where all the Inhabitants were of the Religion; but this was contrary to the expreſs order of the Duke of <hi>Rohan;</hi> who underſtanding that they were beſieged, with all ſpeed rallies his Troops, and comes to relieve them: The Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> on the other ſide, draws all the Garriſon out of <hi>Montpellier;</hi> the Regiment of <hi>Normandy</hi> alſo, with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others, come to joyne with him. His Army with his Canon, he ranged in Battailla, in a place of great advantage: <hi>Rohan</hi> going to view him, that he might know whether he ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt this relief by day, or in the night-time, findes him to be four thouſand Foot, and four hundred good Horſe ſtrong, and ſo advantageouſly lodged that there was no coming at him in any good order, nor without paſſing within Piſtol-ſhot of a dangerous Valley; which made him not diſcover his Troops, and defer ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing with the relief till the night following: He incamps about half a league from the place, in a Valley near a Wood, leaving a Troop of Horſe to obſerve the motions of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> and to hinder the diſcovery of his own Forces: About the cloſe of the evening comes a Meſſenger from the beſieged, to demand ſome aſſiſtance, whom he ſent back again with another with him, to tell them, that when they ſhould hear the Alarme on the other ſide, they ſhould be ready to ſally out at ſuch a place as they ſhould direct them; that they ſhould finde five hundred ſelected men to receive them within Muſquet-ſhot of <hi>Galargues;</hi> and that he, with the reſt of his Army, would be within a quarter of a league ready to bring them off; that if they knew any better way to ſave themſelves, they ſhould acquaint him with it, and care ſhould be taken of them; but, if they approved of this courſe, that they ſhould make three fires upon the top of the Tower, that it might be accordingly followed. The Meſſengers got very well in, and the beſieged alſo approve of the deſign; In witneſs whereof they give the ſignal of the three Fires, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare themſelves for the Sally: The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> ſent the five hundred men he had promiſed within two Muſquet-ſhot, cauſed the Alarme to be given thrice, and yet no body ſtirred in <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largues,</hi> but all ſtayed till day; which being now pretty well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, he drew off his five hundred men, who by a Volley of ſhot at their departure, let them know how near they had come
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:170346:97"/>
to fetch them off: The Duke underſtood afterwards, that ſome of the Captains, who had bad legs, or lame courages, hindred their coming forth; whoſe fears flattering them with falſe and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hopes, made them chooſe rather to ſubmit to their enemies, than run the hazard of marching three or foure hundred paces with ſeven hundred men, with their Swords in their hands, which when they had done, they were ſure to be received by five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred more, and a quarter of a league farther by two thouſand. In great choler, and with an extream regret did the Duke draw off again, the next day, knowing they had yielded themſelves to be diſpoſed of at the diſcretion of their Conquerours, if they procured not the ſurrender of <hi>Aima gues;</hi> which if they effected, then were they all to be ſet at liberty, and have their baggage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to them: <hi>Valeſcure,</hi> and <hi>Baviere,</hi> were choſen Deputies, and ſent with this goodly meſſage to the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> who made them both priſoners; but <hi>Valeſcure</hi> eſcapes, and gets into the <hi>Sevenes,</hi> to incite the Communalties there to an inſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in caſe <hi>Aimargues</hi> were not given up again; others alſo went thither privately from <hi>Montpellier</hi> to the ſame end; <hi>Rohan</hi> fearing ſome commotions in that Province, goes thither too him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and takes with him the Deputies of <hi>Niſmes</hi> and <hi>Vſez,</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles both the Provinces at <hi>Anduze,</hi> where he brought them to this reſolution, that <hi>Aimargues</hi> ſhould not be re-delivered, and that all thoſe priſoners they already had, or for the future ſhould take, ſhould be treated with the ſame rigour as was uſed to thoſe of <hi>Galargues;</hi> and that he might have his revenge, he ſits down before <hi>Monts,</hi> with but two thouſand men at moſt; five dayes did he lie before it, for that the inceſſant rain that fell, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded the arrival of their great Canon from <hi>Anduze,</hi> for the ſpace of three whole dayes together: But though the bad weather miſchieved him on that ſide, it abundantly recompenſed that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurv on another, ſwelling the two <hi>Gardons,</hi> ſo that four or five Regiments, which could they have come the direct way, had reached him in one dayes march, not able to paſs the Rivers any other way, than by a Bridge, were fain to make four or five dayes of it; and he to prolong their journey, cauſes all the Boats, and Ferry-boats upon the Rivers to be broken, and a ſtrong Guard to be kept at <hi>Saint Nicholas Porte;</hi> ſo that immediatly upon the arrival of his Canon, without further fear of any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance, he batters the Caſtle, and reduces the beſieged, a hundred and fifty in number, to ſuch ill terms, that they yielded upon condition to undergo the ſame puniſhment as ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on thoſe were taken at <hi>Galargues,</hi> perſwading themſelves ſtill, that <hi>Hannibal,</hi> to whom the houſe belonged, and who was
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:170346:98"/>
Baſtard-brother to the Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> would be able to prevail with him to ſave his Friends, and Allies: But <hi>Montmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency,</hi> to make his action more eminent at Court, having ſent word that he had taken the prime Officers and Souldiers of the <hi>Sevenes,</hi> the King commanded that all the Colonels, and other Officers ſhould be hanged, and the common Souldiers ſent to the Gallies; which the Prince having notice of, would not give him leaſure to let the Court know what had happened at <hi>Monts;</hi> ſo that he cauſed threeſcore and four to be hanged, which indeed were not all Officers; but many that were well clad, ſtiled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo, out of hopes to finde better uſage; ſee how many times men gull themſelves: The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> alſo, for his part, cauſed the like number to be hanged, not ſparing any for their quality, except ſome few, which he reſerved, to fetch off ſome others, which <hi>Hannibal</hi> had gotten to himſelf, who were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards exchanged.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Montauban</hi> goes on luckily with the War, in which that Town, without the aſſiſtance of any other, alwayes behaved it ſelf beſt of any of the Reformed Party. <hi>Saint Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel,</hi> before he engaged in any other enterpriſe, looks after the preſervation of <hi>Cauſade,</hi> upon ſome jealouſies he had of the Governour <hi>Chaſtillon;</hi> for that in all Military actions he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered too much offeminacy, and too much diſregard of things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the ſecurity of the Town; but principally for that he held too frequent correſpondencies with thoſe of the adverſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, under pretence of procuring the enlargement of his brother, who had been a priſoner ever ſince the laſt peace: Neither was he without ſome ſuſpitions of the others aime to out him of his Government, which made him begin to think upon ſome way to preſerve himſelf in it, to which end he Courts the affections of the Souldiers, and people of the Town; but before he had well made his Game, he moſt imprudently declared publickly, that he would no longer own any ſubordination to <hi>Saint Michel,</hi> who to prevent, and cruſh this miſchief in its birth, exhibited the Articles he had to charge <hi>Chastillon</hi> withall to the Council; whereupon it was ordered that he ſhould be ſecured, and tried by a Council of War; which was neatly carried by <hi>Saint Michel,</hi> who very privately, and inſenſibly having gotten many Souldiers into <hi>Cauſade,</hi> and coming thither himſelf unthought on, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any the leaſt commotion, ſeizes upon <hi>Chastillon,</hi> and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries him to <hi>Montauban,</hi> where he was for a time kept priſoner, and examined: But whether it was, that the proofs againſt him were not clear enough, or that they feared leſt the puniſhing of him would be a diſcouragement to other ſtrangers; he was ſet at

liberty again; and <hi>Pontbeton</hi> was made Governour of <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſade</hi> in his place; who continued in that command untill the Peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saint Michel</hi> having thus ſecured this Town, thinks upon taking in of many ſmall Forts, and Caſtles, which were a great diſturbance to <hi>Montauban;</hi> having now a fit opportunity offer'd him by the plague, that had driven away moſt of the Garriſons the Duke <hi>d' Eſpernon</hi> had left about him; in purſuance of which he drawes his Canon into the Field, and begins with the Caſtle <hi>de la Motte d' Ardne,</hi> and having battered, and taken it by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, fired it on the ſecond of <hi>September:</hi> When he came back to <hi>Montauban,</hi> he had intelligence of a great body drawing up, compoſed of the Countrey Forces, and ſome other Regiments alſo, ſent for purpoſely to oppoſe his deſigns: On the 6th. of the ſame Moneth he lays an Ambuſcade for them among the Vineyards of <hi>Dieu-Pantole,</hi> about two leagues diſtant from <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauban,</hi> and with his Horſe goes to draw them into it, and meets them in the plain of <hi>Caſtalans,</hi> and <hi>Saint Porquier,</hi> where the enemy, without expecting till the reſt of their men were come up, or indeed ſtaying one for the other, purſue him in diſorder up to the very Ambuſcade, where being once engaged, he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges them on every ſide, and leaves ſome four or five hundred of them dead upon the place, beſides a great number of wounded, loſing not above three or four of his own: Thence he marches up to the very Towns of <hi>Caſtalans,</hi> and <hi>Saint Porquier,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Villages, and Farms, which he fired, and then returns to <hi>Montauban.</hi> The next day he beſieges the Caſtle of <hi>Ville-Dieu;</hi> which having endured the battery a whole day, yielded the next; thoſe within it had their lives given them, but they remained pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners of War, and the place was burnt. On the 8th. of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> he went from <hi>Montauban</hi> to beſiege <hi>Eſcaliez,</hi> about two leagues from <hi>Montauban;</hi> but thoſe of that Garriſon ſtayed no more for him, then did thoſe of <hi>Blavet,</hi> both which retreated to <hi>Salvagnac;</hi> theſe two Forts he alſo burnt: And becauſe <hi>Mouli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ere</hi> Governour of <hi>Villemur,</hi> had now his Regiment on foot, he was very deſirous to invite him into an Ambuſh alſo, which he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to do, by firing the Mills of <hi>Villemur,</hi> which were in ſight of the Town, whence yet none would ſtir out; in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn thence he came before the Caſtle of <hi>Poulauron,</hi> which he forced.</p>
               <p>The Garriſon of <hi>Salvagnac</hi> being thus re-inforced with thoſe of <hi>Eſcaliez,</hi> and <hi>Blavet,</hi> began now to grow inſolent, and would no longer ſtand to the Agreement made with thoſe of <hi>Montauban,</hi> to ſuffer them freely to paſs, and repaſs; whereupon
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:170346:99"/>
he laid an Ambuſh for them alſo; to allure them to which, he ſent out ſixty Horſe, and fifty Foot, when preſently came forth an hundred, or ſix ſcore Souldiers, to gain the Ford upon the River <hi>Teſcou,</hi> where they met with ſuch entertainment, as very few of them ever went back again.</p>
               <p>About the beginning of <hi>November</hi> ſallied out ſixty ſeven Souldiers from the Garriſon of <hi>Loubejac,</hi> to lay an Ambuſh near <hi>Montauban,</hi> upon the great Road to <hi>Negrepeliſſe;</hi> which <hi>Saint Michel</hi> having notice of, drew out ſome Horſe, and layed a Counter-Ambuſcade in the way by which they were to retreat; and charging them in an open field, ſlew about threeſcore and four of them; and after this, took the Caſtle of <hi>Bourquet</hi> by Petard. Many other little actions paſſed there at <hi>Montauban,</hi> in which <hi>Saint Michel</hi> alwayes came off with honour.</p>
               <p>It is now time to return to the lower <hi>Languedoc,</hi> whither preſently after the taking of <hi>Monts,</hi> came the newes of the Reddition of <hi>Rochelle,</hi> after the long ſufferings of that poor people, had given ſuch large teſtimonies of their invincible conſtancy.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Rochellers</hi> upon the retreat of the ſecond Fleet, ſent four ſeveral Meſſengers to <hi>England,</hi> with inſtructions all to the ſame effect; <hi>viz.</hi> To repreſent unto the King, the deplorable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they would ſuddenly be reduced to, and minding him of his promiſes, to beſeech his Majeſty with all ſpeed to ſend them ſome relief, aſſuring him withall, that how many, and heavy ſoever their preſſures were, they would not ſubmit to them, but wait his anſwer: <hi>La Groſſetiere,</hi> who was one of the four, arrived there on the 15th. of <hi>June,</hi> and was ſent back again with many fair promiſes on the 30th. but in his return was taken, carried to the King, kept a priſoner till the Town was taken, and was then put to death. The 10th. of <hi>July</hi> following came the ſecond, and on the 14th. arrived the third; but the laſt, who came about by <hi>Holland,</hi> was ſome-what longer on his way.</p>
               <p>Before the arrival of <hi>la Groſſetiere,</hi> had the King of great <hi>Britain</hi> diſpatch't <hi>la Lande</hi> with two other Souldiers, to give the <hi>Rochellers</hi> notice of the great ſupplies he was preparing for them; and after him was alſo ſent <hi>Champfleury</hi> with the like aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances, who got into <hi>Rochelle,</hi> but one day before the Fleet ſhewed it ſelf in the Rode: The ſhips preparing for this expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being not yet finiſhed, the Engineers pitched upon a new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, to wit, the lotting out of three ſhips lined, and the decks covered with brick, and laden with ſtones of an immenſe bigneſs, and ſtuffed with barrels of powder, to make theſe Mines play effectually upon the Barricado the <hi>French</hi> had made in the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:170346:99"/>
Port: But the King of <hi>England</hi> very much unſatisfied with the flow progreſs of the Fleet, went himſelf in perſon on the laſt of <hi>July</hi> to haſten it, in which journey the Duke of <hi>Soubize</hi> wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on him.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> ſtaying behind, ſets his wits on work to find out ſome means to obſtruct the ſending away of the ſupplies, and to this end, endeavours by the means of the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Reſidents in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> to have ſome over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for a peace made: But ſeeing that took not, he reſolves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a journey to <hi>Portſmouth;</hi> but before his departure, ſends for <hi>Vincent,</hi> a Miniſter of the Church of <hi>Rochelle,</hi> and makes him write a perſwaſive letter to the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> to diſpoſe themſelves to accept of the peace the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> was now procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for them; which the Embaſſadour of <hi>Savoy</hi> having an inkling of, he plainly demonſtrates to <hi>Vincent,</hi> that it was only an invention to retard the departure of the Fleet, and ſo defeated that project.</p>
               <p>At length, on the 24th. of <hi>August,</hi> comes the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> to <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> and on the 29th. arrived there fifty ſhips, ſome men of War, and others laden with proviſion, and ammunition: But on the ſecond of <hi>September,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bize</hi> going to viſit the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> as he had newly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, he told him that juſt then he had received intelligence of the re-victualling of <hi>Rochelle,</hi> and that he was now going with the newes to the King; and as he was lifting up the Hangings to go forth of the Room, he was ſtabbed with a Knife, into the great Attery of the heart, by an Officer, whoſe name was <hi>Fellon,</hi> of which he fell, and dyed immediatly: Nor were the Duke of <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bize,</hi> and his followers free from danger, it being muttered in the Chamber, that it was a French-man had done this act; but <hi>Felton,</hi> who might have eaſily eſcaped, if he had liſted, having not been obſerved by any one, voluntarily diſcovers himſelf to be the Authour of this Homicide; ſaying, that it was better that two men ſhould periſh, than a whole Kingdom. The next day the King makes the Earle of <hi>Lindſey</hi> Admiral, <hi>Morton</hi> Vice-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, and <hi>Montjoy</hi> Reare-admiral; the other commands were not changed, but the ſame Captains that were in the former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, went alſo in this, with a greater force, but the ſame reſolutions. After the death of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> it appeared that not half of the Ammunition and Proviſions for the Fleet were yet ſhipped; and that ſhould the proſecution of their buſineſs an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the ſlowneſs of the beginnings, there would be yet three moneths work more to do; but by the care, and preſence of the King, more was now diſpatch't in ten or twelve dayes, than in many
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:170346:100"/>
weeks before; ſo that all things being now ready, they ſet ſaile on the eighteenth of <hi>September:</hi> That which made the Duke of <hi>Soubize</hi> conceive better hopes of this than the former Fleets, was the care and diligence uſed by the King, and the command he gave his Admiral, in his preſence, not to do any thing without his advice; committing the charge of this expedition conjoyntly to them both.</p>
               <p>On the nine and twentieth of <hi>September</hi> came the Fleet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Rode of <hi>Rochelle,</hi> and after a calm, which continued all <hi>Sunday</hi> and <hi>Munday</hi> following, at night the Wind aroſe, and ſate faire for a ſight, ſo that about two houres before day, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Admiral's firing of a Gun, they all ſet ſayle, and at ſix of the clock in the morning began a fight, which laſted about three houres, in which, on both ſides, were diſcharged three or four thouſand piece of Canon, and that was all: The next day about the ſame houre was the fight renewed, but more tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, and at a greater diſtance, ſo that both thoſe fights were concluded without any great loſs to either ſide: On the third of <hi>October</hi> comes up to them <hi>Friquelet</hi> a Captain that had formerly ſerved under the Duke of <hi>Soubize,</hi> and coming, as he ſaid, from <hi>Tremblade,</hi> ſhews a Letter from the Captain <hi>Treſlebois,</hi> deſiring him to know of them whether they would hearken to a Treaty of peace or no; to which was anſwered, that he ſhould ſhew his paſs-port, or elſe that <hi>Treſlebois</hi> ſhould come up in his Shalloup between the two Fleets, and there let them know what he had to ſay; which, on the ſeventh of the ſame moneth, he did, with one whoſe name was <hi>de l' Iſle,</hi> both who were remitted to <hi>Montague</hi> and <hi>Forain,</hi> who, finding that they had no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Commiſſion, but came only to know whether the <hi>French</hi> would Treat apart, excluding the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> anſwered them, that that could not be, and ſo both retired to their own Parties: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs upon occaſion of this interview the Admiral ſent <hi>Montague</hi> with a Dutch Gentleman whoſe name was <hi>Kimphauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen,</hi> under colour of demanding of ſome Mariners, that were Priſoners in the <hi>French</hi> Fleet; but his going thither again the two dayes following, pretending they had promiſed to ſhew him the Barricado in the Port, and confeſſing, at his return, that he had not ſeen it, becauſe the Tide did not ſerve, bred ſome jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies, that he went thither upon ſome other deſign; And when, upon a report that there had Articles mutually paſſed between them, the Duke of <hi>Soubize</hi> complained that they had entred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Treaty, unknown to him, and without the Privity of thoſe that were principally concerned in it; it was flatly denied: But when the continual goings to and fro of <hi>Montague,</hi> had confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:170346:100"/>
their ſuſpicions of a Treaty, it was put off with this excuſe, that they treated of things not relating to theirs, nor the Intereſts of <hi>France:</hi> And not long after, the Admiral ſent <hi>Montague</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> with a paſs which the Cardinal of <hi>Richelieu</hi> gave him.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Sunday</hi> the one and twentieth of this moneth there hapned a remarkable paſſage; one <hi>Pojanne,</hi> a Captain that had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerved under the Duke of <hi>Soubize,</hi> a Villain covered with Crimes, and that had now redeemed his life, by the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he had paſſed to the Cardinal, to kill, or burn <hi>Soubize</hi> in his ſhip, ſets ſaile out of the River of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> in a good ſhip of two hundred Tun burthen, and filled with Combuſtible matter; and, the better to palliate his deſign, paſſes as an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, making prize of ſeveral <hi>French</hi> he met withal, and ſo gets up to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet; When he was come in among them, he tells them that he was come to ſerve the Party of the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as he had formerly done, and deſires to be conducted to the Duke of <hi>Soubize</hi> who knevv him very vvell: With him vvas a Gentleman of <hi>Anjou,</hi> vvho, as he vvas going to <hi>Rochelle,</hi> had been caſt upon the Coaſt of <hi>Spaine,</hi> there taken, and thence ſent to the Cardinal, vvho finding him to be a bold and adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous perſon, promiſed him not only his pardon, but infinite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compences in caſe he would accompany <hi>Pojanne</hi> in this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize: The deſire he had to ſave himſelf together with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions of his brother, who was a ſervant to the Cardinal, made him promiſe whatever they required of him: But when they came to the fleet, he unfolded the whole plot to <hi>Soubize,</hi> whereupon <hi>Pojanne</hi> was taken Priſoner, his ſhip and Prizes ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed on: And to prove that this Gentleman ſaid nothing but truth, he offered to get through into <hi>Rochelle</hi> with the Cardinal's paſs, and to return thence with a true account of the condition of the place: His offer was accepted of, and double Letters were given him, ſome of which he ſhewed to the Cardinal, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting a requeſt to permit him to make this Voyage, and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe at his return to give him a perfect relation of his diſcovery. Thus he got in, and returned with other private Letters, which truly repreſented the ſtate of <hi>Rochelle,</hi> which was ſo ſad, that in caſe they were not relieved within two dayes, there would be none left alive in it, and that they were now upon the point of yielding.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Monday</hi> the two and twentieth, about ten aclock in the morning the Fleets made as though they would engage, but the Captains failing of their promiſed duty, the whole time was ſpent in <hi>Canonades,</hi> without any prejudice to either party, and
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:170346:101"/>
all the fire-ſhips were ſo ill-managed, that they were vainly, and to no purpoſe conſumed: And in the mean time, in ſight of that Puiſſant Fleet, ſo well ſtored with all neceſſaries, while the time ſlipt away, the paſſage unattempted, nor the Duke of <hi>Soubize</hi> his offers, to lead the way with the <hi>French,</hi> deſiring the Admiral but to follow him only, accepted, nor thoſe of the Count <hi>de Laval,</hi> while the others were engaged in the fight, to conduct the three ſhips lined with brick, and in which were the Artificial Mines, up to the Barricado; the famine finiſhed its work in <hi>Rochelle;</hi> there being hardly a man left that could ſupport himſelf without a ſtaff; all that were left alive were ſo few, and ſo debilitated, that they had not ſtrength to handle their Armes; ſo that on the ſame day the Admiral of <hi>England</hi> had reſolved with his Council, once more to attempt the relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of it, the <hi>Rochellers</hi> capitulated, and yielded on the 28th. day of <hi>October;</hi> and on the 10th. of <hi>November</hi> following, the whole Fleet left the Rode, and returned towards <hi>England:</hi> The miſcarriages of this action being imputed to the refractorineſs and diſobedience of ſome particular Captains; ſome of them were confined to their own houſes, and a Commiſſion was iſſued out for their Trial: But in a ſhort time after, all this vaniſhed, and they received their pay as the reſt did.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi>'s Mother, nor his Siſter, would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any particular mention to be made of them in the Capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; leſt the occaſion of the ſurrender ſhould be imputed to their perſwaſions, or the reſpect borne to them; not doubting however, but that they ſhould equally enjoy the benefit of the Treaty with the reſt: But, the interpretation of Articles being commonly made by the Conquerours, it was the Judgement of the King's Council, that they were not compriſed in them, ſince they were not mentioned in them: An unpreſidentable ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that a perſon of her quality, of ſeventy years old, coming out of a beſieged Town, where ſhe and her daughter had lived three moneths together upon Horſe-fleſh, and four or five oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of bread aday, ſhould be detained Priſoners, prohibited the exerciſe of their Religion, and ſo ſtrictly guarded, that they had but one ſervant allowed to attend on them: But all this rigour abated not their wonted courage and zeale to the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of their party: For the Dutcheſs ſent to her ſon the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> a Caution, not to give any credit to her Letters; for that in this reſtraint ſhe might be compelled to write things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to her inclinations, and that the conſideration of her mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable condition ſhould not impell him to any thing that might prejudice the Party, whatever miſchief befell her: A truly
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:170346:101"/>
Chriſtian reſolution, and nothing varying from the whole courſe of her life, which though it had been a continued tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of afflictions; yet, by the aſſiſtance of God, with ſuch for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude comported ſhe her ſelf in them all, that ſhe has juſtly merited the applauſe and benediction of all good people; and will yield poſterity a moſt illuſtrious example of an unparallela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vertue, and admirable piety. Thus this poor Town, once the Cabinet and delight of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, is now become the Subject of the wrath and Triumph of his Son <hi>Lewis</hi> the Thirteenth: It was aſſaulted by the <hi>French,</hi> abandoned by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and buried in a grievous and mercileſs Famine; but in the concluſion, has, by its conſtancy, gained a more glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown in ſucceeding ages, than thoſe, whoſe uninterrupted proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity makes them the envy of the preſent.</p>
               <p>This newes cauſed a wonderful and general dejection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the whole Party, every one caſting about, how to make his own peace; and many made publick addreſſes to that end, alledging, that ſince <hi>Rochelle</hi> was now loſt, for whoſe preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only they had taken up Armes, it was neceſſary that they alſo ſhould make their own compoſitions, before a greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity befell them; On the other ſide the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> by means of the Confederates they had in the Townes of the Religion, infuſed ſuggeſtions into them, perſwading them to a ſpeedy compliance, and that their early ſubmiſſion, would procure them a better reception; offering withal, large recompences to thoſe that could induce their Corporations to ſend their Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to the King, who at the ſame time alſo, publiſhed a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, wherein he promiſed to receive again into his favour and protection, any particular perſons, or Towns that ſhould petition him to that effect.</p>
               <p>The people wearied and ruined with the Warre, and whoſe ſpirits naturally ſtoop to adverſity; the Merchants diſcontented at their loſs of Trading; the Citizens grieved to ſee their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes burnt, and their lands lie idle immanured, and untilled, all encline to a peace upon any terms whatſoever: But of all others the diſtemper of <hi>Caſtres</hi> was the greateſt, by reaſon of the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions between <hi>Chavagnac</hi> and <hi>Saint Germier,</hi> who ſupported by the Conſuls, and others, who ſtayed in the Town purpoſely to miſchieve the whole party, who played their game ſo well with the Council of <hi>Albigeois,</hi> that they procured Deputies to be ſent to the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> to deſire his preſence, without which their ills were irremedible, and to ſummon him, upon his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, to convene a General Aſſembly, which might, together with him, take care of the publique affairs; giving the Deputies
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:170346:102"/>
charge to return with his anſwer as ſoon as poſſible, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly they might reſolve on what they had to do.</p>
               <p>This reſolution, as alſo the election of the Deputies, was made contrary to the advice of <hi>Chavagnac,</hi> one of them being a Kinſman of <hi>Saint Germiers,</hi> yet was he fain to ſubmit to it for the preſent. The project of this meſſage was grounded upon the impoſſibility they conceived of the Duke's being able to come to them; and upon a belief, that were the way open, yet would he never curb his own power by a General Aſſembly; ſo that upon his refuſal they promiſed themſelves a fair and plauſible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, to make their own particular peace, or at leaſt, that making the Aſſembly their own, they ſhould compel him to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to what they liſted: Which the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> foreſeeing, and having alſo, before the arrival of the Deputies, reflected on a General Aſſembly, as the only expedient, to preſerve an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire unity among them, he condeſcended to all their deſires; and that he might loſe no time, took the Deputies with him to <hi>Niſmes,</hi> where they made choice of Deputies for the lower <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc;</hi> thence went they to the <hi>Sevenes,</hi> where they did the like, leaving the time and place for the Convention to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination: He ſent them alſo Orders into <hi>Vivaretz</hi> to elect their Deputies too; and then, having taken Order for the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant fortifications he had begun at <hi>Aimargues,</hi> and all Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons neceſſary to be kept in the two Provinces, during his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, he takes all his Horſe, and five hundred Foot, and with them comes to <hi>Castres</hi> about the beginning of <hi>December,</hi> where he found <hi>Rouſſeliere,</hi> whom the Inhabitants of <hi>Saverdun</hi> had driven out of their Town, by means of <hi>La Plante,</hi> his Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant there, who ſuffering himſelf to be ſeduced by their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, had drawn the Gariſon out of the higher Town, and given it up into their hands: This was alſo much promoted by the miſ-intelligence happened between <hi>Mazaribal</hi> (whom the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> upon the death of <hi>Saint Estienne,</hi> had made Governour of <hi>Foix</hi>) and <hi>la Rouſſeliere;</hi> upon this occaſion; for that <hi>Mazaribal</hi> his facility made him too much yield to the follicitations of ſome of the Inhabitants of <hi>Mazeres</hi> (whoſe vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainy was not then known to him, as he confeſſed afterwards, and that he took them for perſons well-affected to the Party) to uphold the Enemies of <hi>la Rouſſeliere</hi> both in <hi>Saverdun,</hi> and <hi>Carlat;</hi> which made him requite his courteſie, by ſhewing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour alſo to all againſt whom <hi>Mazaribal</hi> had any Picque; and to ſuch a height grew their animoſities one againſt another, that <hi>Mazaribal</hi> obſtructed, as much as he could, the payment of the Gariſon of <hi>Saverdun,</hi> and gave free paſſage to the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:170346:102"/>
that ran from <hi>la Rouſſeliere;</hi> which much elevated the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of his enemies, who cheriſhed <hi>Mazaribal</hi> with hopes, that in caſe they could rid themſelves of the other, they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him into his place; but when, upon the expulſion of the other, he had a minde to go thither to reap the fruits of their promiſes, they reduced his train to a leſs number at the firſt, and ſhut their Gates upon him the ſecond time; but proteſted notwithſtanding to continue firm to the Party; which neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, when they had ſufficiently ſecured the place, they utterly abandoned it, and preſently made addreſſes by their Deputies, to the King. It was then (but too late) that <hi>Mazaribal</hi> clearly perceived the wicked intentions of <hi>la Rouſſeliere</hi>'s enemies, whoſe Treachery he could not now ſufficiently aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> did, when he came to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stres,</hi> was to aſſemble the two <hi>Colloques</hi> of <hi>Albigeois</hi> and <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raguais,</hi> to acquaint them with the reſolutions of the lower <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and the <hi>Sevenes,</hi> and to incite them, by the others example, to chooſe Deputies alſo for the General Aſſembly; the like was alſo done by <hi>Montauban, Foix,</hi> and <hi>Roüergne:</hi> After this he endeavoured to compoſe the difference between <hi>Chavagnac</hi> and <hi>Saint Germier,</hi> which was now grown into ſo formal a quarrel, that mutual challenges had paſſed between them: But though <hi>Saint Germier</hi> refuſed not to ſubmit to a reconciliation, yet would he not condiſcend to own <hi>Chavagnac,</hi> as his Superiour in the Town of <hi>Caſtres:</hi> But on the contrary he profeſſed publiquely, and in private, and even in the Council-Houſe, that he would oppoſe him in all things, and in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. This made the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> think of removing him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the lower <hi>Languedoc;</hi> to which end he offered him a Troop of Horſe, and an honourable allowance for himſelf and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue; but his Partiſans, ſeeing that this tended to the diſſipati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their faction, diſſwaded him from it, promiſing him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that if he could find out any way to evade that employment, they would make him Maſter of their Town.</p>
               <p>The Duke alſo, finding the great ſcarcity of Corn was in <hi>Caſtres,</hi> to ſupply that want, gets them to reſolve to borrow ten thouſand Crowns to buy ſome; and offered them, during his abode there, ſufficient Convoyes to conduct it ſafe thither: But ſeeing that could not be effected, he ſeeks out ſome other way to ſupply the neceſſities of the Town: And underſtanding that there was a great quantity at <hi>Saint Amant,</hi> which lies in the Valley of <hi>Mazamet;</hi> he claps a Petarde to the Town, and
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:170346:103"/>
by that means enters it, and beſieges the Caſtle, which being hardly preſſed, yielded alſo, and at three or four Convoyes, was the greateſt part of the Corn carried to <hi>Castres:</hi> This exploit was performed by <hi>Chavagnac;</hi> He ſent alſo for more proviſions to ſome of the Religion, that living as Neuters, hoped by that means to ſecure themſelves againſt all parties.</p>
               <p>He cauſed <hi>Donaret</hi> the firſt Conſul of <hi>Realmont,</hi> who was a great inſtrument of the taking of the Town, to be tried, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted; but with much difficulty, for that having married the Preſident <hi>Monteſpieu</hi>'s Neece (ſuch perſons ſeldom wanting In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſours) they were loth to pronounce a ſentence of Death againſt him: After this, the Winter came on ſo furiouſly, that he could not proceed in his intended Deſigne upon <hi>Braſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſac.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whiles he ſtayed at <hi>Castres,</hi> he alſo defeated two ſeveral ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations for particular Peaces: The firſt was carried on by <hi>Dejan</hi> a native of <hi>Montauban,</hi> who having formerly bought the Office of Provoſt of the Town, which the Corporation op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as a thing long before aboliſhed, after a long ſuit, and a great expence of money he was faine to accept of what he had disburſed: This man being at the Court, had freſh hopes given him of this Office, in caſe he could effect any thing in this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation: To this Lure he ſtoops, and having his Commiſſion diſpatched, comes away with two Letters from <hi>Galand;</hi> one for <hi>Montauban,</hi> and another for <hi>Castres.</hi> At the firſt place he was refuſed, and referred to the Duke of <hi>Rohan;</hi> and as for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, he durſt not go directly thither, but approaches as near it, as <hi>Bouquiere,</hi> which is about a League from it, and thence Writes to <hi>Dupuy,</hi> to let him know that he was very deſirous to ſpeak with him about a buſineſs of great importance; but he ſent him word again, That he could not do it, unleſs he would firſt acquaint him with the nature of it: Whereupon he eſſayes a ſecond time to prevail with him, but in vain; ſo that not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to come into <hi>Caſtres,</hi> he was fain to return again without any further ſatisfaction: Thus his Voyage bringing no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the Court, was nothing beneficial to himſelf neither, who reaped no fruits at all of thoſe many fair hopes were given him.</p>
               <p>The other was managed by the Biſhop of <hi>Mende,</hi> who was ſomewhat more zealous in it, as ſhall be ſeen in another place; but for the preſent he diſcovered himſelf thus far, and to the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> too; that being a ſervant to the Cardinal, he had received a Commiſſion to Treat with particular perſons, and Corporations, either ſeverally, or conjunctively, and eſpecially
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:170346:103"/>
with him; that if he would hearken to him, he would procure him conditions, in which he ſhould find what ſatisfaction he could deſire; but if he would hear of none but a general Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he muſt not expect ſo good; and ſo openly did he diſcover his purpoſes, that <hi>Saint Michel</hi> Governour of <hi>Montauban,</hi> fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leſt he ſhould engage in a Treaty without his Privity, ſent a ſervant of his own towards the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> to obſerve what was done, that the intelligence he ſhould receive of the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions there, might direct him how to ſteer his courſe; vvho, vvhen he ſavv that the Duke vvould not liſten to a Man not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered by any Commiſſion, nor admit of any clandeſtine or particular Treaty, diſcovered himſelf, and told him, that he was ſent to inform him from the Governour, that the Biſhop had made ſome overtures to him concerning a particular Treaty for <hi>Montauban,</hi> but that he had rejected his Propoſitions; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs if he had any inclinations to a general Treaty, he was very well acquainted with him, and could do him much ſervice in it.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, the Biſhop nothing ſatisfied with <hi>Rohan</hi>'s anſwer; and rightly conjecturing, that his preſence would be injurious to his deſign; reſolves to have patience, untill his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into the lower <hi>Languedoc;</hi> that in his abſence he might the more effectually prevail upon the ſeveral Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>There remained nothing more now, than by a Provident fore-ſight, to prevent all inconveniencies, might intervene at <hi>Caſtres,</hi> during his abſence: To this end he ſettles in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulate perſons of great integrity, and no leſs fidelity to himſelf, baniſhing from the Town three of the old Conſuls, and ſome others alſo, of whom he had great jealouſie; and placed there four Companies of Foot, for whoſe ſubſiſtence he alſo provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: The buſineſs of <hi>Saint Germier</hi> was the only thing he could not handſomely cleare, becauſe he had abſented himſelf from the Town; which obliged the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> to make an Order, prohibiting <hi>Chavagnac,</hi> and the Conſuls, to give him, or any of his brothers, any admittance into it; and, in caſe he came not in to them within the ſpace of eight dayes, to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim him a deſerter of his Party: He ſent alſo a Company of Foot into <hi>Roque-courbe,</hi> and another into <hi>Viane;</hi> forbidding them alſo to receive <hi>Saint Germier</hi> and his brothers, and leaves three hundred Men, which he brought out of the lower <hi>Langue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc,</hi> in <hi>Saint Amant,</hi> where, for their maintenance, he allotted them their proportions out of a part of the Corn was found there.</p>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:170346:104"/>
               <p>When he had done this, he went with the Deputies of the General Aſſembly towards <hi>Niſmes,</hi> where he ſaw the ſtorm was like to fall, and where his preſence would be moſt neceſſary; and conceiving it alſo a very convenient place for the General Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, made no long delays after his arrival there, before he form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it.</p>
               <p>The firſt and moſt important affair that fell under their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, was that of <hi>Caſtres: Saint Germier,</hi> after the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> thence, animated by the Fugitives of <hi>Caſtres,</hi> and importuned by thoſe of his Faction, that were left in the Town, whom his Mother, and his Wife, whoſe Sex priviledged their ſtay there cheriſhed in their diſcontents, reſolves to return thither again, and indeed he himſelf was the fourth man that came to the Gate, and meeting with no oppoſition there, he goes up directly to his quarters, where thirty or forty perſons flocking to him, perſwade him to go out into the Market-place, aſſuring him, that all the people would joyn with him, <hi>Chavag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nac,</hi> who was then at Church, having notice of his arrival, raiſes his Garriſon, commands his own Troop to make ready, and reſolves to charge him, wherever he ſhould meet him; but his Lieutenant, <hi>l' Espuguet,</hi> being very opportunely mounted with about twenty of his men to go out upon a party, hearing the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larme, goes directly to the place where <hi>Saint Germier</hi> was, and without taking any other notice of him, charged him bravely; in which action he received five wounds, and loſt one of his men; but he ſlew and wounded many of the others alſo, whom he ſo ſcattered, and diſperſed, that they had no more mind to rally again. Upon this rumour, the Conſuls and Conſiſtory in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe in the buſineſs, and inſtead of detaining him priſoner, too charitably mediate for his quiet departure again: This is that which uſually ruines all publick affairs, the indulgence ſhewen to offenders, under the goodly pretence of piety and clemency, which in other mens matters every one cries out for, when as their own particular intereſts will not endure to hear them mentioned.</p>
               <p>This mild comportment of theirs towards <hi>Saint Germier,</hi> inſtead of pacifying, renders him more haughty than before, puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing him up with a vain opinion, that this courteſie was an effect of their fear; ſo that encouraged by his followers, and by the aſſiſtance of many Thieves, and Villains, that had ſheltered themſelves in <hi>Roque-Courbe,</hi> he gets into it, drives out the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, and makes himſelf Maſter of the place; the Aſſembly General fore-ſeeing the evil conſequences this would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, ſent a Deputy to <hi>Caſtros,</hi> with order to communicato his
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:170346:104"/>
Commiſſion to <hi>Chavagnac,</hi> and the Council of the Province, and to endeavour to compoſe this difference, by ſubmitting it to the determination of Arbitrators; to the end they might not provoke <hi>Saint Germier</hi> to give away the Town; which being now in his poſſeſſion, he laughed at all mentions of an Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo that the Deputy at his return, reported to the Aſſembly, that all he had been able to do, was to confirm <hi>Roque-Courbe</hi> in their reſolutions for the Reformed party, which they had anew engaged themſelves by Oath, never to relinquiſh; but that for the preſent it was impoſſible to diſpoſſeſs <hi>Saint Germier</hi> of it; but yet that there was great probability that a little patience, together with his imprudence, would give them what they aimed at; and in effect, a few dayes after, when he urged the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants to declare for the King, who knew well they muſt then ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to a <hi>Romiſh</hi> Garriſon, they turned many of his Faction out of the Town, which ſo terrified him, that thinking himſelf no longer ſecure there, he leaves the place alſo, and goes with them to <hi>Cam,</hi> a houſe not far from it; which when <hi>Chavagnac</hi> had intelligence of, he beſieges, and takes him, and one of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, with fifteen, or ſixteen others, half <hi>Romanists,</hi> and half of the Reformed Religion, whom he ſent to the Duke of <hi>Rohan:</hi> And yet after ſuch actions as theſe, found he many Advocates, who deemed it too great a ſeverity to detain him priſoner, till the peace, and ſeemed alſo much diſcontented that his whole equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page was not reſtored him, and a Troop of Horſe given him, that he might ſerve the party as formerly, and this was the concluſion of this affair.</p>
               <p>And now the Biſhop of <hi>Mende</hi> renewes the purſuit of his deſign, with an Eſſay upon <hi>Montauban,</hi> to which end he ſent thither <hi>Vieres,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Quercy,</hi> who feigned himſelf to be of the Religion, and wrote to the Town to this effect, that being now going with the Kings Paſs-port to wait upon the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> with ſome propoſals tending to the general advantage of them all, he would not proceed in his journey before he had acquainted them with them, which if they pleaſed to receive from his Relation, he was confident they would approve of them.</p>
               <p>It was not thought fit to admit him into the Town, for fear of the danger might enſue; but yet the natural curioſity of the <hi>French,</hi> at ſuch a time, when every one breathed nothing but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of a peace; made them very ſollicitous to know what he had to ſay: Wherefore they ſent four Commiſſioners to receive his meſſage, whom he told, that being of the Religion himſelf, he could not but be very zealous for the general welfare of their
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:170346:105"/>
party, and that the Biſhop of <hi>Mende</hi> having full power to treat, he was going from him, to the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> and the general Aſſembly, with ſome propoſitions to that purpoſe; which, that they might be the better reſſented, and that their Town might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo have their part of the thanks, and benefit thence accruing, he adviſed them to ſend thither ſome Deputies alſo, offering the Kings Paſs for their ſafe conduct; when this was reported to the Common-Council of the Town, they approved of the advice, and preſently made choice of ſome Deputies, of which they alſo advertiſed the Aſſembly.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> had great jealouſies of this <hi>Vieres,</hi> whom he had a long time I nown for a notable cheat; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, with great impatience was this Addreſs expected; the report of which being generally divulged, ſuſpended all other thoughts, every one hoping to derive ſome advantage from it; three weeks paſſed without any further mention of it, at length came a diſpatch from <hi>Montauban,</hi> importing, that they had receiv'd intelligence from the Biſhop, that he could not obtain the Paſs-ports promiſed by <hi>Vieres;</hi> but that if they pleaſed to ſend their Deputies to perſwade the General Aſſembly to accept of ſuch a peace, as the King ſhould vouchſafe to accord them, and in caſe they refuſed to comply, that they themſelves were reſolved to ſubmit to his pleaſure, he vvould engage himſelf for the ſafe conduct of their Deputies: This diſcovered the vvhole fallacy to the Tovvn, and made them reſolve anevv to remit all propoſitions for peace to the General Aſſembly, vvhich they exactly obſerved in that, made them by the Marſhal <hi>de la Force,</hi> to this effect, that the King vvas reſolved not to iſſue out any Declaration for a general peace; nevertheleſs, if they vvould Treat every one particularly, the King admitting of all ſuch Treaties, and refuſing a peace to no Tovvn, it vvould at laſt inſenſibly prove a general one.</p>
               <p>When this buſineſs of <hi>Montauban</hi> vvas over, came a very ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent diſpatch from <hi>Vivaretz,</hi> grounded upon this occaſion, that the Army vvhich lay before <hi>Rochelle,</hi> after the taking of the Tovvn, vvent under the command of <hi>Toiras</hi> into <hi>Auvergne,</hi> to refreſh themſelves, and that they were now upon a March to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the upper <hi>Vivaretz,</hi> to go thence to <hi>Valence</hi> in <hi>Dauphine,</hi> there to wait the arrival of the King; this their ſo near approach, gave the whole Countrey a hot Alarme; eſpecially <hi>Sojon,</hi> which <hi>Chevrilles</hi> about ſix Moneths before had ſeized, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified; ſo that with great inſtancy they demanded a ſupply both of men and ammunition. The lower <hi>Languedoc</hi> furniſhed them with fifteen hundred men, the command of which was given by the Dake of <hi>Rohan</hi> to <hi>Saint André de Montbrun</hi> as his field
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:170346:105"/>
Marſhal, with whom were alſo ſent the Horſe belonging to <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſagne,</hi> who about three moneths before, was taken priſoner; to whom in this place I muſt give his merited honour, publiſhing to the World with what generoſity he with-ſtood both the Menaces, and Flatteries of the Court; for, he being the firſt Conſul of <hi>Niſmes,</hi> and of great authority, and reputation there; they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by his means to raiſe a powerful faction there, and wholly take off that Town from their adherence to the Reformed Party.</p>
               <p>But to return to thoſe of <hi>Vivaretz,</hi> all whoſe fears the King's Army having tranſported with them over the <hi>Rbone</hi> into <hi>Dauphine,</hi> they countermand the Troops were coming to their aſſiſtance, which turned to their great prejudice; for that being now a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then to the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> who knew not yet well how to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of them, he was feign to ſeek out ſome employment for them, between <hi>Vivaretz,</hi> and the <hi>Sevenes;</hi> and to this end he ſent <hi>Saint André</hi> orders to make an attempt upon <hi>Saint John de Valle-Franciſque;</hi> and for the more convenient proſecuting of a deſign upon <hi>Villeforte</hi> or <hi>Poſtes,</hi> to ſecure <hi>Genovillac,</hi> and <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berigand;</hi> he begins with <hi>Saint John,</hi> which he takes, as alſo the Fort of <hi>Chamberigand,</hi> and ſome other places, which were like to incommode him, and then takes up his quarters at <hi>Geno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villac;</hi> whence he marches with intention to block up <hi>Ville<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort;</hi> but finding the Marqueſs <hi>de Portes</hi> upon the way with a greater power than his, ready to diſpute the paſſages with him; he forces him from them, and ſo advances to <hi>Ville-fort,</hi> thinking to have lodged his men in the Suburbs; but being not able to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it, he retires to <hi>Genovillac,</hi> and <hi>Saint Germain,</hi> and thence informs the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> that his men would leave all their Colours, unleſs they were drawn off thence; whereupon he gives orders for their quartering at <hi>Saint Ambroix, Barjac, Valon,</hi> and <hi>la Gorce;</hi> that they might be in a readineſs to march to <hi>Privas,</hi> upon any occaſion ſhould ſummon them thither.</p>
               <p>In the mean time came to him new aſſurances from <hi>England,</hi> that he ſhould never be deſerted, nor any peace made, without compriſing the whole body of thoſe of the Religion in <hi>France</hi> in general, and his Family in particular; encouraging him alſo to a conſtancy in his reſolution, and not to be diſmayed at the loſs of <hi>Rochelle:</hi> Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> alſo of <hi>Savoy</hi> ſent a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to him, to let him know, that if he continued in his former humour, and would advance towards him, he would give the King a handſome diverſion in <hi>Dauphine,</hi> and meet him upon the <hi>Rhone</hi> with ten thouſand Foot, and a thouſand Horſe; to whom he replied, that he was now in a better humour than ever, and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:170346:106"/>
ready to march upon the firſt ſummons he ſhould receive from him.</p>
               <p>The King in the mean time goes towards <hi>Dauphine,</hi> but becauſe the plague was at <hi>Lyons</hi> Lodges at <hi>Vienne,</hi> and appoints the Rendez-vous to be at <hi>Grenoble,</hi> where preparation was alſo made of all things neceſſary for the relief and victualling of <hi>Cazal;</hi> the jealouſies theſe preparatives raiſed in the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> made him look about him in ſeveral quarters, there being an Army in Province ready to fall upon <hi>Nice;</hi> another in <hi>Breſſia</hi> to keep <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi> in awe, and the King himſelf marching with the third to the ſtreights of <hi>Suſa,</hi> which is the Key of <hi>Piedmont;</hi> ſo that the Duke was fain to divide his Forces, that he might be ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himſelf in any part where the ſtorm ſhould fall, and to call in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Forces to aſſiſt him in the defence of <hi>Suſa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The preſent ſtate of affairs, gave great probabilities that the King would now have employments enough to divert him a long time from looking after thoſe of the Religion; and upon occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome reports diſperſed among the people of <hi>Niſmes,</hi> that if they had any inclinations to ſue for a peace, all neceſſary Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports for their ſafe conduct ſhould be given them; the Aſſembly took care to enquire after the Authours, and truth of theſe Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; but finding them to be all fictions, and the inventions of ſome Counſellours of the Preſidial of <hi>Niſmes,</hi> or of ſome of the Inhabitants that had been expulſed the Town; or of ſome of <hi>Aiguemortes,</hi> ſome of them ſet on by the Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> others by the Marqueſs of <hi>Varennes,</hi> out of an intention to ruine them, by ſowing diviſions among them, rather than to procure them any good; the Aſſembly made a Decree, that all perſons that had any propoſals or overtures to make for a peace, ſhould firſt bring them to the Aſſembly, that they might be examined by them, and improved to their advantage; expreſſely prohibiting alſo all perſons from ſuch clandeſtine, and malicious buzzing of reports among the people, to take them off from proceeding in the Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications they were then upon.</p>
               <p>And next they fell upon the conſideration of a courſe to procure a firm and laſting peace; whereupon they laid down this for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible ground, that it could not be ſuch, unleſs it were made conjoyntly with the King of <hi>England;</hi> neither could he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf procure any upon ſo good terms, without a previous diſcent into <hi>France,</hi> whither he was now invited by ſo many conſiderable emergencies to favour him in the enterpriſe; the King being now at the other end of his Kingdom with his beſt Forces, proſecuting a deſign, was to be executed without it; where he ſhould have to
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:170346:106"/>
oppoſe him, the Forces of the Emperour, the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi> To this effect a letter was written to him in the name of the Aſſembly, and the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> beſeeching him to embrace this offered opportunity, and confirming the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations formerly made by thoſe of the Religion in <hi>France,</hi> not to engage in any Treaty, but conjoyntly with him: And for as much as their want of money was great, and that without ſome Forrain aſſiſtance, it was impoſſible to keep their men together, or advance their Fortifications, the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> was ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to write to <hi>Clauſel,</hi> that they could no longer ſubſiſt without a ſupply of money, and that he ſhould let the <hi>Spaniards</hi> know, that the peace of <hi>France</hi> could be no longer prevented, without a ſudden recruit. It was alſo reſolved, that they ſhould endeavour to procure ſome private Paſs-ports, that they might with more ſecurity ſend into <hi>England;</hi> upon aſſurance to be given to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe all things to a peace: <hi>Du Cros</hi> of <hi>Montpellier,</hi> who, with the conſent of the Marqueſs <hi>de Foſſe,</hi> came to give the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> a viſit, returned from him with the ſame promiſe, which was alſo confirmed by the whole Aſſembly.</p>
               <p>Thus were they careful not to omit any thing that tended ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to their own defence, or the procuring of a peace, even at ſuch a time, when they had fairer hopes of good ſucceſs in their affairs than ever; but God, who had otherwiſe determined of them, blaſted all their projects: For the King, who left not <hi>Paris,</hi> to go to the relief of <hi>Cazal,</hi> till he had privately gotten an aſſurance out of <hi>England,</hi> which freed him from the fear of any invaſion thence, whil'ſt he was engaged in that expedition, and made him confident of a peace with that Nation, excluding the Reformed Party, would not admit of any addreſſes from them, fearing leſt they might prevail ſo far upon him, as to induce him to alter his determinations concerning them: To which may be added, that ſurprizing his enemies by a nimble march, in the dead of Winter, he eaſily gained the ſtraits of <hi>Suſa,</hi> and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly after the Town alſo; which brought ſo great a terrour on them all, that <hi>Don Ganzales</hi> raiſed his ſiege from before <hi>Cazal;</hi> the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> alſo, to prevent the loſs of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> folli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited for a peace, by which he was obliged to re-victual <hi>Cazal</hi> The King, that he might himſelf witneſs the performance of all Conventions, remained about a moneth longer in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: And then leaving <hi>Toiras</hi> with four thouſand Foot, and five hundred Horſe in <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and the Marſhal <hi>Crequi</hi> with the like number at <hi>Suſa,</hi> bent all his thoughts, and the reſt of his Forces upon the War in <hi>Languedoc;</hi> in order to which he commanded the Marſhal <hi>Schomberg</hi> to advance before to <hi>Valence,</hi>

               <p>In the interim of theſe preparations the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour than reſiding at <hi>Thurin,</hi> gave the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> notice of the peace concluded there; but that it was not like to be of any long continuance; that the Army was now marching towards him, but in ſo tattered a condition, that if he could but ſtand the firſt ſhock, he would ſoon find ſuch diverſions made, as would be much to his advantage. <hi>Clauſel</hi> encouraged him yet much more with promiſes of a ſudden ſupply both of Arms and Money. <hi>Niſmes,</hi> and <hi>Aimargues</hi> went but ſlowly on in their Fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Vſez</hi> a little better; but yet no Town would give quarter to any Souldiers, till they were upon the point of being beſieged; which drove the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> to his uſual way of offering to each particular Town to pull out for them, the Thorn, that pricked them: And firſt he addreſſes himſelf to <hi>Sauve,</hi> with over-tures of an attempt upon <hi>Corſonne,</hi> whither he goes; but findes it a matter of greater difficulty, than his information had given him cauſe to apprehend; for having battered their Works, the Walls were not to be ſcaled, but with Ladders of a very great length; ſo that thoſe he had brought with him proving too ſhort, he was neceſſitated to make all new again; which gave the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal <hi>d' Estrée,</hi> (urged by the Marqueſs <hi>de Foſſe</hi>) leaſure to march to the relief of it with ſix thouſand Foot, and four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horſe; whereupon the Duke drew off again to <hi>Sauve;</hi> and the next day being deſirous to view the Marſhal's Army as it marched, and who then took up their quarters at <hi>Sommieres;</hi> it was demonſtrated to him, that he could not get back again to <hi>Saint Gilles,</hi> but he muſt paſs the <hi>Vistre</hi> near to <hi>Aimargues;</hi> or the <hi>Gardon,</hi> if he intended to go for <hi>Vivaretz,</hi> as it was repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted he did, at both which places he might with eaſe be diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and with advantage fought with: The Duke, that he might not loſe this opportunity, writes to <hi>Vſez</hi> for ſome more Forces,

and ſends <hi>Aubais</hi> to <hi>Niſmes</hi> for the ſame purpoſe; <hi>Leſques</hi> goes to <hi>Auduze</hi> for others, accompanied by <hi>Goudin,</hi> and <hi>la Baume;</hi> he ſent alſo to <hi>Saint Hippolyte,</hi> and the neighbouring Garriſons for more Augiliaries, appointing his general Rendez-vous to be at <hi>Vauvage;</hi> and he himſelf ſets out by break of day with two thouſand Foot, and fourſcore Horſe, to ſecure <hi>Caniſſon,</hi> a large, but unfenced Town, whence he might be ſure to take his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage which way ſoever the Marſhal ſhould take, but whether it was that he had the ſame deſign upon <hi>Caniſſon;</hi> or that he had intelligence of the Dukes marching thither with ſo ſmall a Force; he found him alſo upon his march from <hi>Sommieres</hi> towards <hi>Caniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;</hi> nevertheleſs the Duke having the advantage of the way, goes on directly to the Town, and there began to ſecure the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venewes of it with his Van, that the reſt, (conſidering he was purſued by an Army twice ſtronger than his own) might in good order poſſeſs themſelves of the Town; but the extream heat of the day, and fame of the good Wine, wherewith that place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded, had already drawn thither the greateſt part of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, ſo that it was impoſſible for him to govern them; when on a ſudden he heard many Muſquets in his Rear, which was then skirmiſhing with five hundred Muſquetiers, which the Marſhal had ſent before to try if they could break it; whil'ſt he, with the reſt of his Army ſtayed upon a little Hill which gave him a view of all the Countrey, and what was done even in <hi>Caniſſon</hi> it ſelf, whence perceiving the great and general confuſion there, he gave Orders for a general aſſault: The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Montredon</hi> to rally his men, together with <hi>Carlincas,</hi> Enſign of his Guards; whiles he himſelf draws out a hundred of his own Guard, whom he led up to the Caſtle of <hi>Caniſſon,</hi> which being ſeated on a little Hill, commands the Town, and circumjacent quarters, ſo that it is not eaſily aſſaultable on any ſide, enjoyning them ſtrictly to look well to the defence of that place. This done, he goes round the Town, which he begins to fortifie with ſtrong Barricadoes; juſt as he had finiſhed his cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit, he meets with <hi>Leques, Goudin,</hi> and <hi>la Baume,</hi> and tells them that of neceſſity they muſt reſolve to defend the out-places, untill the Barricadoes were finiſhed: <hi>Leques</hi> undertook the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, goes to the head of his men, and ſeeing that the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that were in the Caſtle, had quitted it, haſtes thither with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whom he placed in their rooms; and ſo eagerly diſputed he his poſt without the Town, that when he would have retreated thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he found the enemy had intercepted his paſſage, ſo that he was fain to take the Field: <hi>La Baume</hi> was alſo ſerved in the like kinde; as for <hi>Goudin,</hi> the Duke would not ſuffer him, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

of his wound, to ſhut himſelf up in the Town; but when he had taken the beſt courſe he could to preſerve his Foot, he drew off with his Horſe to <hi>Niſmes</hi> to haſten away the relief he had before ſent thither to prepare.</p>
               <p>In the mean while <hi>Montredon,</hi> the Major General, <hi>la Boiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiere,</hi> and <hi>Alizon,</hi> after they had from poſt to poſt, diſputed the out-quarters, retreated into <hi>Caniſſon,</hi> where they had no ſooner taken their ſeveral poſts to defend, but they received a general and furious aſſault; but neceſſity animating the Defendants, they bravely repulſed the Aſſailants; and whiles they looked on, perfected their Barricadoes; then got the enemy into ſome hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which they began to break through, thinking by that way to open themſelves a paſſage into the Town, but they were ſoon fired from that attempt; this ſtorm laſted from Noon till Night; the Officers within behaved themſelves with much gallantry, both in rallying, and encouraging their men; but <hi>Montredon, la Boiſſiere,</hi> and <hi>Alizon,</hi> who commanded in chief, got moſt honour in this action; both parties had their inconveniencies; thoſe within wanted ammunition, thoſe without proviſions; ſo that, that very night the Marſhal <hi>d' Eſtrée,</hi> offered the beſieged a Parley, which they rejected, telling him withall, that they ſhould ſoon ſee the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> there with freſh Forces, to make them remove farther off, and indeed that night had he ſent two thouſand men of <hi>Niſmes,</hi> under the command of <hi>Aubais,</hi> to get as near <hi>Caniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> as poſſible, and to let the beſieged know, that he was now come ſo far to their aſſiſtance; but he returned again, without giving them any notice of his arrival, either by Meſſenger, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſignal made, as he was expreſly commanded; none daring to adventure on the employment; and indeed, ſo ſtraitly were they inveſted, that it was impoſſible for any one to get in to them; this much troubled the Duke, who having refreſhed his Troops, reſolved to go thither in perſon, and either ſave his men, or loſe himſelf: To which end he ſent <hi>Leques</hi> Orders to have the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of <hi>Aimargues</hi> in a readineſs to joyn with him; but whil'ſt he was preparing for their relief, came newes to him of the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation, which was made upon theſe termes, That the beſieged ſhould with all ſecurity march off to the <hi>Sevenes;</hi> that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal <hi>d' Estrée,</hi> ſhould not enter the Town of <hi>Caniſſon</hi> with his Army; but that the ſaid Army ſhould be drawn up in Battailla, at a great diſtance from the way they were to paſs; that the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of both ſides, which could not be carried off, ſhould with all ſafety remain in the Town; and that for the performance of theſe Articles, Hoſtages ſhould be mutually given, all which was pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually obſerved on both parts; of the party of thoſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:170346:108"/>
were ſlain about fifty or ſixty, and above double the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber wounded: of the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> were there four hundred ſlain, and eight hundred wounded.</p>
               <p>This was the iſſue of this action, in which the Duke of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han</hi> was very like to have received a check, would have proved fatal both to himſelf, and his Party too: But now imagining that it was not without cauſe that the Marſhal ſo earneſtly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued this deſign; but that his Forces were intended for the Countrey about <hi>Niſmes,</hi> he conceived he would again paſs the <hi>Viſtre</hi> near <hi>Aimargues,</hi> that he might the ſooner recover his quarters at <hi>Saint Gilles,</hi> which made him deſirous yet once more to ſee him; for which purpoſe he took two thouſand of the Foot of <hi>Niſmes,</hi> and his Horſe, with whom he came to <hi>Aimar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues;</hi> the next day he drew them up in a place between <hi>Aimar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues</hi> and the Paſs, with intention to charge him when he ſhould be half over; which the Marſhal having notice of, he changed both his deſign, and road, and lengthning his way a dayes journey, paſſed the River at <hi>Aiguemortes;</hi> and the Duke retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>Niſmes:</hi> And ſeeing the preparations were making on all hands for the invaſion of the lower <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venes,</hi> he got the Towns of the lower <hi>Languedoc</hi> to receive their Gariſons; aſſignes the Regiments of <hi>Goudin, Fourniquet,</hi> and <hi>Bonal,</hi> to <hi>Niſmes;</hi> thoſe of <hi>la Baume</hi> and <hi>Faulgeres</hi> for <hi>Uſez;</hi> and that of <hi>Sandres</hi> for <hi>Aimargues;</hi> After this, and the taking of the Fort of <hi>Sojon</hi> by the Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> which coſt him but three dayes time, though <hi>Chevrilles</hi> had promiſed to hold it out three weeks, the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> having learnt the particulars of the Treaty for <hi>Vivaretz,</hi> made by <hi>Chevrilles</hi> with the Keeper of the ſeals for twenty thouſand Crowns; he thought it now high time to look after the ſecuring of it; and ſent <hi>Saint André de Montbrun</hi> with five hundred Foot, and ſome of <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſagne</hi>'s Horſe, to <hi>Privas,</hi> whither he got very happily, having defeated <hi>Montreal</hi> and <hi>l' Eſtrange,</hi> who waited for him at ſome untoward paſſes in his way, with a farre greater ſtrength than his. At his arrival there, he found the Conſuls with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Council aſſembled at the Town Houſe; who told him that indeed they had formerly wiſhed for his company, but that at preſent, they having no need of any Souldiers, it would be but a burthen to them; and yet, that they might with the better grace refuſe to admit his party into their Town, promiſedto quarter them in the Villages that lay thereabouts; which <hi>Saint André</hi> perceiving, was the more reſolute to quarter in the Town: <hi>Chevrilles</hi> who was then at <hi>Cheyla,</hi> was ſent for in all haſte, and coming thither the next day with thoſe of his Faction, he
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:170346:109"/>
preſently aſſembles the Council of the Province, and of the Town too, to perſwade them to requeſt <hi>Saint André</hi> to return again, and that in caſe their intreaties were ineffectual, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him to it by the ill uſage of his Men: which <hi>Saint Andrè</hi> having notice of, he goes in to the Aſſembly, and there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares that he was ſent thither, by the command of the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> who only had power to recall him againe; and that whatever their determinations ſhould be, he would not ſtine a foot thence without his Order: When <hi>Chevrilles</hi> ſaw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thus fallen from his hopes, he tells <hi>Saint André,</hi> that in caſe the Town ſhould be beſieged, he would do them better ſervice without than within the place; that he would raiſe fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred men, and would put as many of them into it, as he ſhould think neceſſary, and with the reſt would forrage and cut off the proviſions from the King's Army.</p>
               <p>His propoſition was well approved of, and on the morrow he departs: And not long after were there three Barques laden with Salt taken upon the <hi>Rhone: Saint André</hi> haſts thither, but came not time enough, for that ſome Frigots had already forced thoſe that had taken them to quit their Prize: Nevertheleſs in this excurſion he learnt that the King was come to <hi>Valence</hi> but with a ſmall guard, believing, upon the information he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived concerning that particular from the Keeper of the Seals, that the Treaty of <hi>Vivaretz</hi> was abſolutely concluded; but that finding that the coming of <hi>Saint André</hi> thither had altered the whole face of things there, he was now preparing for the Siege of <hi>Privas,</hi> which was to be blocked up with in four or five dayes: Large offers was he tempted with, even to the value of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Crowns, but his generous refuſal of them ſhewed him to be a perſon full of honour and fidelity: At his return to <hi>Privas</hi> he makes them all reſolve to abide a ſiege, engaging them alſo by an Oath, that the firſt man, that ſhould but menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Capitulation, ſhould be put to death: Then he aſſignes to every one their reſpective poſts; and Orders the repairing of the out-works, to which, before his coming, nothing at all had been done; nor yet could he begin them, but the very day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Town was inveſted, and yet ſuch diligence uſed he in it, that ſome of them were made very defenſible, and held out bravely.</p>
               <p>The ſiege was ſcarce begun, when the Catdinal came up with the reſt of the Army that ſtayed behind at <hi>Suſa:</hi> He preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <hi>Chevrilles</hi> to the performance of his engagement; who that he might not wholly loſe the recompence of his Treaſon, deſires to have a part in the honor of the Siege, offering to bring in with him 15.
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:170346:109"/>
hundred men; his offer was accepted, and he comes in, but all alone: The next day came a Trumpet from the King (accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with <hi>Argencourt</hi>) to ſummon the place: <hi>Chevrilles,</hi> who failed not to be at the place, whither the Trumpet was to come, ſent one of his Captains to know what he had to ſay, which when <hi>Saint André</hi> was informed of, he haſted thither with all diligence, and ſent him back again without any anſwer at all: Whereupon <hi>Chevrilles</hi> ſeeing him reſolved not to give them time to deliberate, whether they ſhould hearken to a Capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or no, leaves them again the ſecond time, carrying with him as many men as he could, and was alwayes the occaſion that the Souldiers of <hi>Bouttieres</hi> went not thither to their aſſiſtance, amuſing them ſtill with promiſes to conduct them thither time enough, by this meanes ruining the endeavours of thoſe whom <hi>Saint André</hi> had ſent thither purpoſely to invite them to their aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>He was no ſooner gone, but <hi>Brunel</hi> of <hi>Anduze,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded five Companies of the <hi>Sevenes,</hi> confederating with the other Poltrons and Traitours, frames a conſpiracy to kill <hi>Saint André</hi> in caſe he ſhould refuſe to furrender the place; and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by ſome of his Faction, threatens to give him up, if he denied to comply with them: Whereupon it was thought fit by the Council, that he ſhould have a conference with <hi>Gordes,</hi> which he had, but they could not agree upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</p>
               <p>After that the Cardinal was come up to them, they more cloſely blocked up the place on every ſide, made their approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and batteries, and then gave it an aſſault, from which they were bravely beaten off with the loſs of many of their men; yet did this ſtorm ſo terrifie the beſieged, that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly urge <hi>Saint André</hi> to give <hi>Gordes</hi> another meeting: But in his room was ſubſtituted, and ſent <hi>Vennes</hi> a Captain in the Regiment of the Guards, who offered him very honourable terms for himſelf, and the Souldiers, but nothing at all for the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants; all which he refuſed, proteſting that he would never deſert them: When <hi>Saint André,</hi> at his return, gave the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Town an account of the interview, it ſtruck ſo great a terrour into them, together with thoſe of <hi>Vivaretz,</hi> that they all quit the Town, and flie to <hi>Boutieres,</hi> leaving <hi>Saint André</hi> with five hundred men only to defend a place, which was not to be maintained under two thouſand. In this extremity he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives it his beſt courſe to draw off to the Fort of <hi>Toulon,</hi> where he might Treat with more ſecurity, it being impoſſible to force him there in any ſhort time, or without the loſs of a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:170346:110"/>
of Men: About break of day <hi>Deffiat, Gordes,</hi> and <hi>Vennes,</hi> deſire a conference with him, which he condiſcended to; at which they make him no larger offers than of his own life only, in caſe he would abandon his Souldiers, which he generouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, and returned to embrace the ſame fortune with them: When they ſaw this made not any impreſſion on him, they ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned him once more to ſend ſome of his Officers to them with his final reſolution: <hi>Brunel</hi> of <hi>Dauphiné</hi> offering himſelf for this employment, was accepted of; three journeys made he to them, in which time being corrupted by the enemy, he returns from the laſt with àn aſſurance of all their lives; but adding withall, that they would not give any thing under their hands, untill <hi>Saint André,</hi> with ſome of his Captains had caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at the King's feet to implore his pardon; and moreover that the Count of <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> who was to preſent him to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, had given him a ſtrict charge to tell him, that he ſhould haſte to him with all ſpeed, that he muſt not now loſe any time; and that he did with much impatience wait for him: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he aſſembles his Captains, who all earneſtly importune him to go; which when he ſcrupled at, they break out into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen reproaches againſt him, charging him with having enſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them in a danger from which he would not endeavour to free them: Forced by their invectives, he goes out with five Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptains; <hi>Saint Preüil</hi> and <hi>Fourille</hi> conduct him into <hi>Saint Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s Chamber, where, the Cardinal coming to him, told him, that ſince he was come forth, without any parole given him, he was now a Priſoner: Then was he forced to write to thoſe in the Fort, to adviſe them to yield at diſeretion, and that they ſhould receive the ſame uſage he did; who, refuſing to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit thoſe Letters, or <hi>Brunel,</hi> who was ſent with them, deſire to ſee <hi>Saint André,</hi> who was conducted up to the Fort with a ſtrong guard: As ſoon as they ſaw him, they imagined them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſure of their lives, and thereupon reſolved to give up the Fort: Thoſe that firſt entred it, fired ſome barrels of powder, purpoſely to colour the cruelty they were commanded to execute upon thoſe that were in it: <hi>Saint André</hi> and his Captains were kept Priſoners: Thus were moſt that were in the Fort betrayed to their deſtruction; ſome of the Priſoners being hanged, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſent to the Gallies.</p>
               <p>I have related the particulars of this affair, to let the world ſee how that the perfidie of <hi>Chevrilles,</hi> the two <hi>Brunels,</hi> and of the moſt conſiderable perſons in <hi>Privas</hi> occaſioned the miſerable deſtruction of their Town, and a great part of the Inhabitants, ruined the relief of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and fruſtrated thoſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:170346:110"/>
of an opportunity to obtain a very advantageous Peace; which, ſince the publication of that with <hi>England</hi> (which was made during this Siege) they had entred on a Treaty upon with the Marqueſs <hi>de Foſſé,</hi> who was to that end impowered by the King's Commiſſion: But the taking of this place, as little dreamt of by the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> as thoſe of the Religion (conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their brave reſiſtance at the beginning of the Siege) quite ruined that affair: For <hi>Du Cros</hi> had procured conference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Aubais, Dupuy,</hi> and <hi>Lucan,</hi> Deputies of the Aſſembly general, with the ſaid Marqueſs; and although at their firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview, he refuſed to proceed, unleſs they would recede from their demands, concerning the demolition of the fortifications; yet with more advantage might they have Treated, while the King was further off, and <hi>Privas</hi> held out, than when he ſhould come into the <hi>Sevenes,</hi> and there diſcover the Factions, weakneſſes, baſeneſs, and Treacheries, that were too frequent among thoſe of the Religion.</p>
               <p>The loſs of <hi>Privas,</hi> from whence was expected a longer op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, ſurprized the whole Party with terrour and amazement; and put the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> in mind, that it was now high time to go to the <hi>Sevenes,</hi> to take Order for the ſecurity of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and to oppoſe the firſt attempts that ſhould be made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it: This Voyage was hitherto retarded by his fear to leave <hi>Niſmes</hi> (which many endeavoured to ſeduce from its fidelity) till he had ſupplied it with Souldiers, which, untill compelled by neceſſity, they would not receive; and withall by reaſon that having reſolved to leave <hi>Leques</hi> there to command in chief, in caſe it ſhould be beſieged, he durſt not diſcover his intentions in that particular too ſoon, becauſe he knew that <hi>Aubais</hi> aimed at the ſame command, and that he endeavoured by ſecret pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices to render <hi>Leques</hi> odious to the people, and make himſelf to be deſired by them: In the like perplexity was he for <hi>Uſez,</hi> where <hi>Goudin</hi> ambitioned the Government, but was abſolutely refuſed by the Inhabitants: Nevertheleſs, at length he ſets out from <hi>Niſmes,</hi> goes to <hi>Uſez,</hi> and thence takes <hi>Faulgiere</hi>'s Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with him to <hi>Aletz,</hi> and thence put it into <hi>Saint Ambroix,</hi> in hopes that the oppoſition that place would make, would give him more leaſure to provide for the <hi>Sevenes,</hi> where he thought to have found a good ſum of money ready raiſed, out of ſome Farms he had engaged for his Leavies; but the apprehenſion of the King's coming into thoſe parts, made moſt of the Farmers refuſe to disburſe any: Upon their default he propoſed another expedient, that the Bayliffs ſhould advance the money for the Leavies, and that, for their re-imburſement both of the Principal
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:170346:111"/>
and Intereſt, ſhould be aſſigned them not only the aforeſaid Farms, but alſo an impoſition then newly laid upon the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; but all theſe inventions, being not of force to extract any money out of their purſes, the Duke was fain to addreſs himſelf to the Communalties.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Marſhal <hi>d' Eſtrée,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Trimoüille</hi> began to ravage the Countrey about <hi>Niſmes,</hi> where there paſſed many handſome skirmiſhes, in which, thoſe of the Town (who killed and wounded twelve or fifteen hundred of the enemy) had alwayes the better, except one day, when ſome of the Inhabitants, too inconſiderately advancing, were ſurprized by the Horſe, who dealt ſo roughly with them, that, beſides thoſe which were wounded, there remained forty dead upon the place, and had not <hi>Leques</hi> come in with freſh Troops, there had been much more miſchief done: For his own part he was ſorced from his Horſe, which was killed under him; but the Forragers came not within Canon-ſhot of the Town.</p>
               <p>The King on his ſide loſes no time, but after the taking of <hi>Privas,</hi> ſends part of his Army towards <hi>Gorce</hi> and <hi>Barjac,</hi> which were given up into his hands: <hi>Beauvoir</hi> and <hi>Saint Florent</hi> make their peace, and then turn Brokers for the places belonging to the Reformed Party: The former of them comes to <hi>Saint Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broix,</hi> to perſwade the Inhabitants, to imitate the example of <hi>Barjac;</hi> which the chiefeſt of them were ſo ready to conſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, that, had not the Souldiers interpoſed, the thing had been then done: Nevertheleſs they continue their correſpondencies, ſo that upon the King's approach, though he had no Canon with him, nor could have any come up to him within eight or ten dayes, fear united the two Factions in the Town, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were at mortal odds, and both together force the Souldiery to a compliance with them, ſo that the Capitulation was agreed on, upon condition that the Souldiers ſhould no more beare armes for the Reformed party: At which Article, when one of the Captains ſcrupled, the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> told him, that none ever treated with the King upon any other termes, but that it was but a formality only, and obliged no man farther than he pleaſed himſelf: And then flatters one, and another, with promiſes of great rewards, if they would repaire to <hi>Aletz,</hi> and ſerve the King there, by joyning with the Count of <hi>Aletz,</hi> who had promiſed to give him up the Town: Thither then marched all the Souldiers from <hi>Saint Ambroix,</hi> where they excuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by revolving all the blame upon the Inhabitants, who compelled them to yield the place; promiſing withall, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:170346:111"/>
the Treaty, they would ſerve the Reformed party, wherever they ſhould be commanded. The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> was then at <hi>Aletz,</hi> but had no Forces ready for ſervice, but the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of <hi>Foulgieres,</hi> and five or ſix new raiſed Companies; the King being then within three Leagues of him with all his Army, the people of <hi>Aletz</hi> very wavering, and uncertain whether they would ſtand upon their defence or no; and the Baron of <hi>Aletz,</hi> who had promiſed to deliver up the Town, that he might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter effect it, would by all means be Governour of it; but the Duke was deſirous to place <hi>Aubais</hi> in that command, for that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Field-Marſhal, every one would have ſubmitted to him, and promiſed to leave with him all the beſt men he had; but he excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelf; for that being refuſed, the Government of <hi>Niſmes,</hi> he had taken up a reſolution, never to ſtay within any beſieged place. Then offers he it to <hi>Aſſaz,</hi> to whoſe age and experience every one would have born an honourable reſpect; but he alſo abſolutely refuſed it: Whereupon he ſpeaks to <hi>Boiſſiere</hi> concerning it, whoſe modeſty, not ſuffering him to think himſelf ſufficient for it, made him refuſe to accept of the charge, as Commander in chief; but offered to ſtay there as ſubordinate to <hi>Aubais,</hi> or any other the Duke ſhould think fitting; ſo that in this extremity he was fain to leave there one <hi>Mirabel,</hi> an old G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>tleman of <hi>Viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retz,</hi> of a weak ſight, and as feeble limbs: And when the King came to take up his quarters within a League of <hi>Aletz,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> took the Baron <hi>d' Aletz</hi> with him, and went thence that very morning before the Town was inveſted; promiſing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his departure, to ſend them what ſupplies of Souldiers he could poſſible; of which he took ſo great care, that at ſeveral times he ſent them in above fifteen hundred; beſides the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was there before, which at length he raiſed to five and twenty hundred in the whole.</p>
               <p>When the King ſaw himſelf fruſtrated of his hopes of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the place without force, he ſent for his Canon, and, (that he might loſe no time) began his approaches; part of the Town of <hi>Aletz</hi> is ſeated on a Plain, and the other ſo near the Hills, that they command above half of it; the River <hi>Gardon</hi> runs ſo near the Walls, that it is rather prejudicial, than uſeful to the Fortifications; for that being but a ſmall Torrent, fordable in moſt places, and running ſo near the Town, it leaves no ſpace for any Flanker to be made; nor could it be fortified with in the walles by reaſon of the houſes which made a part of them; ſo that there was no way to ſecure that part of it, but by raiſing Works on the other ſide of the River, and Forts upon the little Hills, which command all a good diſtance from them, and muſt
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:170346:112"/>
be joyned by a Line of Communication to two great ſtone-bridges, which croſs the River. In ſhort, it was a work of vaſt labour and expence, nor could the Town be kept, but by a great number of men, which was the reaſon it was never till then fortified; But the people now ſeeing that <hi>Anduze</hi> was fortifying, would needs imitate their example; a malady which raigned in moſt of the Communalties of the <hi>Sevenes,</hi> and this diſcovered its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, when the Duke was abſent, and upon his Voyage into <hi>Foix;</hi> who though he well knew there were already more fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations begun, then they had Souldiers to man, yet would he not croſs them in their humour, for fear of vexing and diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them; there was yet this further miſchief in it, that beſides that, they took things beyond their power to accompliſh; when once the firſt heat was over, they would not employ what they had as they ought, nor would they work, but when compelled by their fears; to which I muſt yet adde this, that when they were moſt intent upon the raiſing of theſe fortifications, it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to perſwade them to ſtore themſelves with other neceſſaries requiſite to the defence of their Town; for in ſuch deſigns one expence draws on another; and if one of theſe four things be wanting, to wit, <hi>Good Works, Ammunition, Victuals,</hi> and <hi>Souldiers,</hi> all other proviſions are but vain and fruitleſs.</p>
               <p>This being the condition of this Town, they were very much ſurprized, having neglected to raiſe a third Fort, which omiſſion, the Duke willing to redeem, in great haſt makes up one of Barrels, which flew in pieces at the firſt on-ſet, and on this ſide only did the enemy raiſe their Battery, between the Bridge, and the Duke <hi>d' Engouleſme</hi>'s Garden; this firſt aſſault ſo terrified the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, that they thought of nothing now, but how to make a handſome compoſition, to which they were incited, by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptains that came from <hi>Saint Ambroix,</hi> and thoſe of the Baron <hi>d' Aletz</hi> his Faction, whoſe ſollicitations wrought ſuch dangerous effects, that they made Holes in their Walls to let the Beſiegers in; which being diſcovered, the breaches were repaired, but the offenders not puniſhed; ſo that the miſchief was only delayed, not remedied; and the diſaffected made more induſtrious to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal their Treacheries: Two or three of the aforeſaid Captains upon their own requeſt were ſent to the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him how weak the place was, both in men and reſolutions to ſtand it out, that the numbers of the Garriſon there before, and of the recruits ſent thither ſince, hourely decreaſed, by their continual ſlight from it; whereunto he replied, that what they had ſaid, could not be; that he very well knew what Souldiers he had left there, and whom he had placed over them, that he would
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:170346:112"/>
daily ſtrengthen them with convenient ſupplies, both of men, and Ammunitions; and therefore perſwaded them to return again to them ſpeedily, to animate them by their preſence; which they plainly refuſed, alledging once for all, that it was the next vvay to be hanged, conſidering their engagements to the Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> vvhen they marched out of <hi>Saint Ambroix;</hi> whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Dake being informed that they had had ſecret conference with the Baron <hi>d' Aletz,</hi> and that they had agreed together that his Cornet <hi>Meſargues</hi> ſhould be ſent into <hi>Aletz,</hi> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded they ſhould be all apprehended, and ſent <hi>Blacquiere</hi> thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a recruit of five hundred men, and an expreſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to kill the firſt man that ſhould but mention a ſurrender; but the malady was then paſt cure, the Townſmen having hid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ammunition, and deſerted the moſt neceſſary Work of terraſſing that part of the Wall which was oppoſite againſt the enemies Battery, ſo that all he could do, was to protect the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation two or three dayes longer, and by that means ſave five and twenty hundred men, which had they been loſt, as were thoſe of <hi>Privas,</hi> it would have deterred all others from any fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture engagement; that which was moſt fatal in this reddition, was the Article ſemblable to that of <hi>Saint Ambroix,</hi> which diſabled them from evermore bearing Arms againſt the King.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the newes of this was brought to the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> immediatly he ſent away <hi>Falquieres</hi> the Lieutenant of his Guards to <hi>Sauve,</hi> where the ſurrender of <hi>Aletz</hi> had ſtruck a general ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour into the Inhabitants; the moſt conſiderable of which, out of hopes of obtaining good conditions for themſelves, by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of their Lord, the Count <hi>d' Aletz,</hi> denied to let him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Town; but <hi>Falquieres,</hi> being of the place, and having much acquaintance in it, by the means of ſome Ladders he had procured, got in; but found the people ſo reſolutely fixed upon an accommodation, that having ſeized upon the Caſtle, and a Tower which commanded the Town, and ſerved it inſtead of a Citadel, told him openly, that they were now reſolved to ſeek out ſome way to preſerve what they had left, and not expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to an utter ruine.</p>
               <p>In the interim the Count of <hi>Aletz,</hi> invited by thoſe that had privately Treated with him, advances with three or four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horſe, within half a League of the Town, where when he underſtood that the arrival of <hi>Falquieres</hi> with his Souldiers, had prevented his entry into the Town, he ſent a Trumpet to them, with offers of fair propoſitions; <hi>Falquieres</hi> could not by any means diſſwade, nor hinder them from ſending back a Meſſenger
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:170346:113"/>
again to aſſure him, that though they could not give him admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance at preſent, yet were they Maſters of all the Forts; and that if the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> did not ſuddenly conclude a general peace, as he had promiſed them, they would, by his aſſiſtance, make their own in particular, not doubting but their example would allure the greateſt part of the <hi>Sevenes</hi> to an imitation of them: To which the Count replied, that it was in vain to expect a General Peace; and that the Duke deluded them with that Airy fancy; but vvhil'ſt he made his ovvn, and that then he vvould leave them in the Lurch; that if they could be a means to dravv off any other corporations from the party, it vvould be much to the advantage of their ovvn conditions, and that they ſhould have but a Garriſon of thirty Souldiers only in their Caſtle, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by himſelf; they aſſured him of their zealous endeavours to effect vvhat they had promiſed, and that vvithin tvvo dayes they vvould ſend him a further anſwer by a Meſſenger of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: <hi>Falquieres</hi> that had ſeen all theſe Envoys, and heard the free, and lond diſcourſes of the people to him, ſent the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> word, that unleſs he recruited him inſtantly with four hundred men at leaſt, he ſhould be turned out of the Town.</p>
               <p>The importance of this unexpected newes perplexed him ſo, that he took aſide three or four of his Officers, in whoſe fidelity he repoſed moſt confidence, to impart it to them, and receive their advice thereupon; ſome of them at firſt ſight conceived that the buſineſs was deſperate, and irremedible, induced to this opinion by their experience in the precedent Wars, of the diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of that Town to the Reformed party; and that being now Maſters of the Caſtle, they might at their pleaſure let in the Enemy; that it would be a thing of great difficulty to ſend them any Souldiers; for that the people of <hi>Anduze,</hi> that very moment expected a ſiege, and had not ſufficient for their own defence, would be very unwilling to part with four hundred men; that if the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> ſhould go in perſon thither, which was the beſt expedient for it, they would preſently raiſe, and diffuſe a report, that he had abandoned all; ſo that it was to be feared, leaſt his endeavours to preſerve <hi>Sauve,</hi> ſhould prove an occaſion of the loſs of <hi>Anduze;</hi> ſo that their advice was to ſend <hi>Falquieres</hi> and his party orders to defend themſelves the beſt they could; and to promiſe them a good aſſiſtance, in caſe the King ſhould draw towards them; but that for preſervation of their ſtores, he would not charge them with any more Forces, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till neceſſity ſhould draw that burden upon them; others were of opinion, that the place was of ſuch conſequence, that the loſs of
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:170346:113"/>
it would draw after it all the <hi>Sevenes,</hi> up to <hi>Vigan,</hi> and cut off all communication between <hi>Anduze,</hi> and the lower <hi>Languedoc;</hi> ſo that the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> would be totally blocked up there, without any poſſibility of breaking through again; that the loſs of it, as was that of <hi>Privas,</hi> and <hi>Saint Ambroex,</hi> would be wholly laid to his charge; and that it might be juſtly feared, leſt the people of <hi>Anduze,</hi> who were known to have inclinations ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious enough, and had ſtore of malignant ſpirits among them, ſhould enter into conſpiracies alſo againſt him; in ſhort, that this extremity gave them a capacity to betray him, and therefore it were better to attempt to ſend four hundred men to <hi>Sauve,</hi> to preſerve both himſelf, and the Town too.</p>
               <p>This Counſel was accepted of, and thereupon he drew out all the Garriſon of <hi>Anduze,</hi> and out of it choſe four hundred men, to ſend to the relief of <hi>Sauve;</hi> but none would undertake the conduct of them, but the Adjutant-General <hi>Randon,</hi> nor he neither; but upon condition that (to ſecute his own honour) the Duke would allow him the liberty to retreat with them again, in caſe he ſaw the King<hi>'s</hi> Army advance towards him; engaging himſelf nevertheleſs not to make uſe of it, unleſs enforced to it by ſome extremity; thus was he fain to expoſe his own, to ſave the honour of another.</p>
               <p>Amid'ſt theſe perplexities, which were no ſmall ones, the Court-faction in the <hi>Sevenes</hi> uſed many ſubtile inventions to induce the Communalties there to a particular Treaty, excluding the Duke of <hi>Rohan;</hi> the moſt dangerous of which, were; firſt, to hinder the march of the relief from <hi>Anduze</hi> to <hi>Sauve;</hi> terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying them with continual Alarms, that a part of the King<hi>'s</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was to croſs the Countrey, which they would overwhelme with blood and fire, ſo that not a Souldier could be perſwaded to ſtir from his houſe; the next was, without his permiſſion to convoque an Aſſembly, to which were ſummoned only thoſe they were ſure would conſent to a Deputation to the Court in the name of many of the Communalties for a particular peace; and the laſt was to aſperſe his honour, by ſcandalous inſinuations, that <hi>Privas,</hi> and <hi>Saint Ambroix</hi> were given up by his eſpecial order; that <hi>Blac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiere</hi> was ſent to <hi>Aletz</hi> for the like purpoſe; and that having made his own conditions, he would expoſe the people to a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of accepting ſuch as the King ſhould impoſe upon them; and in effect theſe, and the like defamatory rumours ſpread abroad, by petty, but very factious perſons, that hoped by ſuch means to raiſe themſelves a fortune, raiſed a general murmur againſt him; for the people, (eſpecially thoſe of <hi>Languedoc</hi>) are naturally prone to believe the worſt, of the beſt, and the beſt, of the worſt
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:170346:114"/>
ſort of men; readily complying with ſuch clamorous perſons, as condemn the actions of other men, when as themſelves do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, but vail their hypocriſie with an indiſcreet zeal, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only to ſedition, and the ſubſerſion of their Religion, and liberties.</p>
               <p>The Duke was at the ſame time ſollicited by often repeated Meſſages from the Provinces of the higher <hi>Languedoc, Foix, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauban,</hi> and <hi>Roüergue,</hi> both for men, and money. <hi>Mazaribal</hi> ſends him word, that unleſs he were recruited with a hundred good men, and pay for them, it would be impoſſible for him to preſerve <hi>Mazeres;</hi> and that without ſuch a ſupply, or a peace, he ſhould within one moneth be forced to quit the Countrey: <hi>Saint Michel,</hi> and the Town of <hi>Montauban,</hi> tell him, that the Prince, and the Duke <hi>d' Espernon,</hi> were drawing down to Ravage the Countrey about them, which they would inevitably ruine, unleſs he ſent them ſome aſſiſtance to prevent it; but that with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men at moſt, and money to pay them, which they earneſtly importuned him for, they made no doubt bravely to repulſe them. <hi>Chavagnac,</hi> and the Town of <hi>Caſtres</hi> remonſtrate to him, that a Famine would inevitably ſurprize them, unleſs they quickly ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in their Harveſt, which they were incapable to ſecure, without a Renfort of a thouſand Foot, and a hundred Horſe, payed for two or three moneths; and money alſo to muſter and diſcharge the Forces of the Countrey; that the Duke of <hi>Venta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,</hi> who with his Army lay round about them, had made them offers of very advantageous conditions, in caſe they would incline to a particular peace, which they hitherto had refuſed, out of hopes of a ſudden, and effectual aſſiſtance, the want of which would neceſſitate them to ſubmit to ſuch a Treaty. <hi>Millaud</hi> alſo preſents him with the ſame doleful Note; and <hi>Alterac,</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Town, plainly tells him, that without a freſh ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of Souldiers, he could no longer undertake the charge of it; and all the reſt of <hi>Vabres</hi> accord in the ſame demands, either of men, or a Peace.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> oppreſt with the hourely increaſe of ſuch calamities, ſaw no other expedient for their remedy, but a General Peace, which alſo was attended with many difficulties; for he conceived that the King, ſeeing to what a low ebbe the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Reformed Party were ſunk, would not abate one jot of the Article touching the Fortifications; and on the other ſide he very well knew, that though the people had no reſolutions to ſtand upon, nor inclinations to prepare for a defence; yet would they never digeſt the demolition of their Works: If he ſhould reſolve to ſtand it out, and ſtruggle with the the threatned extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:170346:114"/>
then he conſidered, that if he quitted <hi>Anduze,</hi> all the <hi>Sevenes</hi> would be loſt, and conſequently all the Garriſons, up to the very Gates of <hi>Montauban,</hi> muſt ſubmit; if he ſtayed there, he ſhould draw a ſiege upon a place no wayes capable to ſuſtain it; but if the King, waving that, ſhould draw towards <hi>Sauve,</hi> the whole Countrey would come in, and every Communalty having made its peace, <hi>Anduze</hi> would be left all forlorn, and disfur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed of Souldiers to maintain it: But the urgency of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs obliging him ſuddenly to fix upon ſome courſe that had leaſt of danger in it, he pitched upon a General Peace; which, though accompanied with never ſo many diſadvantages, would be yet bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than an abſolute diſſipation of the Edicts, which would be the undoubted conſequence of the particular compoſitions of the ſeveral Communalties; in order to which, he ſummoned an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of all the Communalties of the <hi>Sevenes</hi> to be held at <hi>Anduze,</hi> to diſſolve that which was already convened without his permiſſion; and at the ſame time ſent <hi>Montredon</hi> to thoſe that ſate at <hi>la Salle,</hi> to demand a particular Peace; to let them know, that a Provincial Aſſembly, in order to a General Treaty, was convoqued at <hi>Anduze;</hi> and that, if they, notwithſtanding his orders to the contrary, obſtinately continued their Seſſion, he had a command from the Duke to aſſemble the people of <hi>la Salle,</hi> to make known their refractorineſs to them, and to require their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance for the apprehending of their perſons, and carrying them away Priſoners; his perſwaſions, with the annexed Menaces, made them at length diſſolve; for Fear is oftentimes very perſwaſive.</p>
               <p>After this the Duke ſent for <hi>Caudiac,</hi> a Counſellor in the Chamber of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> who had already made ſeveral journies to the Court, in order to a Peace, and was now but newly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned thence; where he found that their only aime, and chiefeſt hopes now, were, a total diſſipation of the party by particular Treaties; him he deſires once again to return thither, and to tell the Cardinal <hi>de Richelieu</hi> from him, that he was a faithful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Kings, that he deſired nothing more, than the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of the State, and the Repoſe of his own party; and with, all, that both he, and the greateſt part of them, would expoſe themſelves and fortunes to all extremities, rather than ſubmit to any Peace, but ſuch as ſhould be General, and Conformable to the former Edicts of pacification; that it was a thing of dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous conſequence to force an armed Party, how ſmall ſoever, from all hopes of ſafety, but what they ground upon their deſpair of any; and that if the King would vouchſafe to admit of a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Treaty, and allow the General Aſſembly but four dayes time only to remove from <hi>Niſmes</hi> to <hi>Anduze,</hi> and Paſs ports for the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:170346:115"/>
ſafe conduct of their Deputies to come, and Treat with his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners; and that in the mean time all Acts of Hoſtility might be ſuſpended, he was confident they ſhould conclude a peace: <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diac</hi> cheerfully embraced the employment, and obtains the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of the four dayes, together with the deſired Paſs-ports, which he himſelf was commanded to carry back to the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</p>
               <p>In the mean time every one is very ſollicitous to draw his own particular advantage out of this ſmall interval: The Kings party continue their practices in the Province; but with greateſt ardour proſecute they the deſign of <hi>Sauve,</hi> whither, when <hi>Randon</hi> came with the four hundred Souldiers, the diſaffected, to exaſperate the others, oppreſs them with quartering, and that they might diſguſt the people with an apprehenſion of the Duke's under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing of them, quarrel at the perſon of <hi>Randon,</hi> as a man of too mean quality to command them; and when, according to his Orders he would have mingled his Souldiers with the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, to ſtrengthen their Guarders in all quarters, they would by no means ſuffer it in the Caſtle, but loudly objected their priviledges againſt that procedure, as an infringement of them; a prevalent motive to work the populace to any thing; ſo that upon this ill uſage of theirs, <hi>Randon,</hi> unadviſedly told them, that in caſe they refuſed him the abſolute command of their Town, he had Orders from the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> to quit it upon the approach of the King's Army: This inconſiderate expreſſion, ſo indiſcreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly let fall by him, and as nimbly taken up by the diſaffected of the Town, had like to have ruined all; for they publiſhed ſtrange Coments on it to the people, crying out, that the Duke had ſent them men to abandon them, when they ſhould moſt ſtand in need of their aſſiſtance, and that deſired only to poſſeſs themſelves of their ſtrength, at their coſt, to purchaſe themſelves better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; ſo that upon occaſion of theſe jealouſies they called a Council, at which they reſolved, to die all, rather than admit any ſtranger into their Caſtle.</p>
               <p>In the mid'ſt of their deliberations came letters from the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> to convoque the Provincial Aſſembly at <hi>Anduze,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult upon ſome Articles for a general peace; which mollified them ſo, that they nominated Deputies to ſend thither: But when the Council was diſſolved, the diſaffected exclaim againſt this as a trick of the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> to defeat their particular Treaty, and to ſurprize, and detain their principal Citizens at <hi>Anduze,</hi> until they delivered up their fortreſſes into his hands: whereupon they thought fit to ſend away the next day, but one Deputy only to ſound the forde, and give them notice how things were carried,

that accordingly thy might be directed in their comportments; and at the ſame time ſent they another privately to the Count <hi>d' A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letz,</hi> to let him know, that the hopes they had newly received of a General Peace, made them yet defer the performance of what they promiſed; but yet that they ſuſpected it for an invention on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to interrupt the progreſſe of the Treaty they were already upon; wherefore they beſeeched him to clear them in that particular, as much as poſſibly he could, and to believe, that in caſe it were not real, that <hi>Sauve</hi> ſhould be at his diſpoſal, of which he might aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure his Majeſty, and that they had received Letters from the Communalties of <hi>Gange, Sunienne,</hi> and <hi>Vigan,</hi> impowring them to treat for them alſo; and that though <hi>Randon</hi> were in the town, yet could they at pleaſure let him into the Caſtle, of which they were ſtill the Maſters.</p>
               <p>The King conceiving, upon this newes, that with much facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he might now poſſeſſe himſelf of the <hi>Sevenes,</hi> in all haſte ſent <hi>Caudiac</hi> word, that he ſhould come back again to him, and let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone the general Aſſembly where it was: This Meſſenger found <hi>Caudiac,</hi> and all the Aſſembly on their way towards <hi>Anduze,</hi> ſo that much amazed, they returned the ſame way they came, and <hi>Caudiac,</hi> as little ſatisfied, goes to <hi>Aletz.</hi> In the meane time <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and <hi>Falquieres</hi> acquaint the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> with the final re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions of the people of <hi>Sauve,</hi> and the frequent Envoyes paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing between them, and the Count <hi>d' Aletz,</hi> and that unleſſe ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable preventions were applyed, the place would be certainly loſt: whereupon he put his power upon the rack for a new ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of ſouldiers for them; and that he might the more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally proceed in the application of his remedies, he ſent to have the wound well ſearched by his Chaplain <hi>Roſſell,</hi> who had been formerly Miniſter of that Church, and of great authority a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them: As ſoon as he came thither, and had gotten the Common-Council of the Town together, he preſented them a true ſtate of their affaires, ſhewing how near they were obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a general peace, if they preſerved the union of the Party, which particular compoſitions would divide and ruine; after all which their condition would be nothing more exempt from fears or hazard; that to introduce into their Caſtle, a Gariſon of a contrary Religion, was not the way to preſerve inviolate thoſe liberties they ſeemed ſo jealous of; that it was ill done to call thoſe ſtrangers, who were their kinred and neighbours, and had forſaken their own Houſes, Wives, and Children, to come to their relief; that to refuſe the Generals Orders, and to ſuch perſons, half the Guard of their Caſtle, when as they allow them that of their Walls, and Gates, was a diffidence ill groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:170346:116"/>
and probably of dangerous conſequence to the Party, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the preſent condition of things; that he very well knew it was publiquely reported, that the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi>'s forces had not acquitted themſelves of their devoir in the Towns lately ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; but that he was as certain that the contrary of it only was true; that at <hi>Privas</hi> the Inhabitants deſerted the relief was ſent to them; that at <hi>Saint Ambroix</hi> and <hi>Aletz,</hi> they compelled the Gariſons to capitulate; and that all the misfortunes that befell thoſe places, flowed from thoſe who either corrupted by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, or perſwaded by their own feares, quickly diffuſed the contagion over all the reſt; that they would do well to beware of ſuch plagues, and for the future to yield a greater obſervance to the General's Orders.</p>
               <p>But all theſe Remonſtrances were not ſufficient to open the Caſtle Gates to give admittance to the ſtrangers, which when <hi>Roſſel</hi> perceived, he made a Propoſition, that the people ſhould nominate a certain number of them, the third of which ſhould be drawn out by lot to be there upon duty every one in his turn, four and twenty houres together. The Common ſort approved of this way; but the Conſuls, who diſliked it, left the Council in diſtaſte; ſaying, that ſince they could be no longer truſted, they would diſcharge themſelves of their Offices: But they were called back again; and before the diſmiſſion of the Council, was the Guard eſtabliſhed. After this <hi>Roſſel</hi> viſits <hi>Puyredon,</hi> one of the moſt eminent of the Town, both for Eſtate, Wiſdome, and Courage, and his particular friend, and one that had diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a great affection to the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> whom he preſſes ſo far, that he at length got from him a confeſſion of the whole negotiation, between the Town, and the Count <hi>d' Aletz;</hi> and upon <hi>Roſſels</hi> aſſuring him, that if they ſeparated not themſelves from the Party, a General Peace would be ſoon concluded; in which ſhould be compriſed the buſineſs of Repriſals (in which he was intereſſed to the value of twenty thouſand Crowns) <hi>Puy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redon</hi> alſo promiſed him, that, whatever were the ſucceſs of the Deputy ſent to the Count of <hi>Aletz,</hi> he would order things ſo, that there ſhould be yet nothing altered for foure and twenty houres.</p>
               <p>When he had diſpatched with theſe, he found that <hi>Randon,</hi> nothing pleaſed with the Agreement, threatned to be gone; but when he told him, that he could not be yet beſieged for four dayes, that if he would have patience but for two of them only, he ſhould be furniſhed with all things he could deſire, he was then better ſatisfied; and <hi>Roſſel</hi> departed from <hi>Sauve;</hi> and meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the way with the Deputy that had been with the Count of
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:170346:116"/>
                  <hi>Aletz,</hi> he imparted to him the great hopes conceived of a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Peace, to which he gave no other reply than only, <hi>God grant it;</hi> but turning his diſcourſe to the Captain, that convoyed <hi>Roſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,</hi> he told him, that the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> had too long abuſed them by his policies, and that he endeavoured yet to amuſe them with hopes of a General Peace, but only to fruſtrate their Communalty of the advantageous conditions they might receive from a particular Treaty; but that they were now reſolv'd to give no further credit to him, knowing that all his talks of a General Peace was nothing but meer deluſion, whereupon the Captain took him priſoner, and carried him with him to <hi>Anduze.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Roſſel</hi> came back to the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> he gave the Duke an account of his negotiation, telling him, that all his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours had no other effect than only ſomewhat to aſſwage the tumour, untill he in perſon ſhould provide a better remedy for it; whereupon he immediately departed thence, and went towards <hi>Sauve:</hi> His arrival there much daunted the diſaffected party; but they were now ſo farre advanced, that they knew not well, how to recede from their engagements: The ſecond Conſul fled to the Caſtle; the Duke ſent to command him thence, which ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons he durſt not diſobey: When he was come thence, and the reſt of the Council were aſſembled, that Duke acquainted them with the four dayes liberty he had obtained, for the adjourning of the general Aſſembly to <hi>Anduze;</hi> that he hoped to procure them ſuch a peace, as ſhould redound to their general welfare, provided, that, renouncing all diffidence and jealouſies one of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, they preſerved an entire unity among themſelves; that he had borne armes theſe eight years paſt, upon no other deſign, but the defence of their Religion and Liberties; for which he had as cleare a zeal, as any of them; but that now he was to know of them, whether they would own him for their General or no, and as ſuch would obey him; whereupon the people crying our, that they would ſubmit to him, he reſumed his diſcourſe, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them that he would then go to the Caſtle, and place there ſuch of the Inhabitants as he ſhould think fit: The Conſuls at firſt refuſed to follow him, pretending, that ſince they were not confided in, they would quit their Offices; nevertheleſs when they ſaw him go up to the Caſtle, and that all the people flocked after, they ſtayed not long behind him, who, when he had tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out, the Guard was then in it, made choice of ſuch a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Townſmen, as he thought ſufficient to keep it, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them by Oath to maintain it under the authority of their Conſuls, and for the general good of the whole party, againſt all perſons whatſoever; which gave great ſatisfaction to the people;
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:170346:117"/>
/pg and when he had left in their Town a thouſand men, drawn from <hi>Saint Hippolyte, Vigan,</hi> and other places, he returned the ſame day to <hi>Anduze.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The news of this came to <hi>Aletz</hi> as ſoon as <hi>Caudiac,</hi> and ſo net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the King's Council, that they exclaimed againſt the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> for breach of promiſe, ſaying, that the King had not ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from <hi>Aletz,</hi> but that the Duke had been at <hi>Sauve,</hi> where he had ſecured, and furniſhed the Caſtle, and the Towers, with ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; nevertheleſs they gave him Orders to return with all ſpeed to the Aſſembly, but told him withall, that the King would not be obliged to any further ſtay at <hi>Aletz; Caudiac,</hi> who clearly ſaw that all this choler flowed only from the defeat of their deſign upon <hi>Sauve,</hi> replied, that the Duke had not bound himſelf by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny engagement not to ſtir from <hi>Anduze,</hi> but not to make any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon the Towns of the adverſe Party; and that to provide for his own, could not be interpreted any breach of promiſe: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this he went to the Aſſembly, whom he found much perplexed about the Article concerning the demolition of their fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for that, beſides the Deputies formerly ſent by them to the Aſſembly, the Towns of <hi>Niſmes</hi> and <hi>Uſez</hi> had ſent others purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to oppoſe that Article, and, if it were poſſible, to draw in thoſe of the <hi>Sevenes</hi> to fortifie them in that oppoſition.</p>
               <p>Whereupon it was thought fit, before they proceeded to any concluſion, that they ſhould have the opinion of the Provincial Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of the <hi>Sevenes,</hi> that accordingly they might order their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions; But that Aſſembly would determine nothing in it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the advice of the Common-Council of the Town of <hi>Anduze,</hi> which they looked upon as a place the moſt concerned in the ſubſiſtance of the new-raiſed buildings, and fortifications, and moſt reſolute to defend them: The Council reported their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to the Provincial, and the Provincial to the general Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; the ſum of which, was, that conſidering the abſolute neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that lay upon them, they ſhould chooſe Commiſſioners to Treat about a peace, and that the management of the Article concerning the fortifications, ſhould be referred to their diſcretions.</p>
               <p>The Aſſembly general, unwilling to undergo the whole burthen of the Treaty, aſſociate with them the new extraordinary Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Niſmes</hi> and <hi>Uſez,</hi> and a like number of the Provincial Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of the <hi>Sevenes,</hi> who altogether reſolved to ſend their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties to the King to demand a peace, and to moderate that Article the beſt they could.</p>
               <p>The Deputies haſte away to the Court, where after ſeveral conferences had, they agreed on many things, but at the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of the aforeſaid Article, the King's Commiſſioners would not
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:170346:117"/>
endure the mention of any mitigation of it; but thereupon ſent back the Commiſſioners, who reported all to the Aſſembly, to whom they plainly diſcovered that it was in vain to hope for any qualification of that Article, which ſeemed to be thrown in as a ſtumbling block among them; whereupon the Town of <hi>Anduze,</hi> and the Province of the <hi>Sevenes,</hi> being again conſulted, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated the inevitable ruine of their Province, unleſs a ſudden concluſion of a General Peace prevented it; for that otherwiſe every one was fully reſolved to compound for himſelf apart; and that the loſs of their Province would certainly draw after it that of the lower <hi>Languedoc;</hi> that the fire was now at their doors, and that they had rather ſubmit to that Article, than fail of a Peace.</p>
               <p>Whereupon after a full debate of the buſineſs, it was at length concluded that they ſhould admit of that Article; and thereupon the Deputies were returned fully impowred to Treat, and conclude a peace: Which done, the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> deſired the Aſſembly to give their Deputies an expreſs charge, that when they had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected their Negotiation for the Publick, they ſhould then mind his particular concernments alſo, which they did.</p>
               <p>Thus was the Peace concluded at <hi>Aletz,</hi> the 27th. day of <hi>June,</hi> in the year, 1629. The ſubſtance of the principal Articles of which, was as followeth.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That a General Pardon be iſſued out.</item>

                  </item>

                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:170346:118"/>
                  <item>11. That all Courts of Justice, Offices of Receipt, and others, be reſtored again to thoſe places, whence they were transferred, during the cate Wars.</item>
                  <item>12. That the Chamber of <hi>Languedoc</hi> be re-eſtabliſhed at <hi>Caſtres.</hi>

                  <item>13. That the Aſſembly of Eſtates in <hi>Foix</hi> be convened at the uſual times.</item>

                  <item>15. And that all Fortifications be demoliſhed.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The Deputies Extraordinary of <hi>Niſmes</hi> proteſted againſt this Peace, Declaring, that if they ſhould accept of it, their Act would be diſowned, and themſelves killed, when they came home; and at their return, threw the blame of the whole buſineſs upon the pretended perfidy of the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> and thoſe of greateſt truſt about him, by whom they ſaid they had been all ſold; and having aſſembled the chief Officers, both Military and Civil, cauſe them to oblige themſelves by Oath to ſtand it out to the laſt, and then ſent to the <hi>Sevenes</hi> for ſome freſh Troops; when they had by this means drawn the Kings Army before the Town, the ſame perſons, who were the Authors of this mutiny, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe themſelves a reputation at the expence of their Fellow-Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, got themſelves impowred as Commiſſioners to Treat for their Town, which derived no other advantage from it, than the ſpoiling of their Fields and Vineyards; and that which accrued to the Deputies themſelves for diſpoſing the Town, to ſupplicate the King to honour them with his preſence.</p>
               <p>The Town of <hi>Vſez</hi> without any heſitation at all, accepted the Peace at firſt; ſo did all <hi>Roüergue,</hi> the higher <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and <hi>Foix;</hi> nor was any place ſuſpected to refuſe it, but <hi>Montauban;</hi> where the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> would not ceaſe his plundering, untill the King had ſent him a ſecond Order to that purpoſe; and the Town it ſelf, as the Cardinal marched that way, declared their acceptance of the General Peace.</p>
               <p>This is an account of what paſſed in this laſt War, in which the aſſiſtance the Town of <hi>Rochelle</hi> had from <hi>England,</hi> ſerved only to conſume their proviſions, and draw a Famine on the City; and the vain, and illuſory hopes with which <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Savoy,</hi> abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the lower <hi>Languedoc,</hi> had like to have proved the ruine of the whole Party.</p>
               <p>God, of his infinite mercy compaſſionating his poor Churches, hath yet intermitted their ſufferings, that by a ſerious repentance of our faults, and a ſincere amendment of our lives, we might at length attract as many benedictions, as our ſins have pulled down calamities on them.</p>
